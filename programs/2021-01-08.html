Alternatively, break each exercise into no more than 3-4 manageable sets with short rest between. In general go smoothly until you complete all the muscle-ups and then push the wall-ball shots hard. Consider that your cardio will be challenged, make sure you breathe well and be technical on the pull-up bar.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>20 bar-muscle-ups → chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>8 double dumbbell chest presses 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb</p><p>12 single-arm bent-over rows (6 each arm) 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb</p><p>16 chest flys 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.

Prefer to break the toes to bar into no more than 2-3 sets with minimum rest between. On the overhead squats break into as few sets as possible. As weight increases sets will be considerably smaller, yet make sure you keep a solid overhead position and move steadily for as long as proper form allows in each one. On the max-reps, less remaining time means more challenging sets, more remaining time means more sets but less challenging. Lift the bar from the ground each time.</p><p>*Note down the tie break.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Max overhead squats 82/57kg – 180/125lb → 70/50kg – 155/110lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A. 3 sets of</p><p>Row, 1500 meters @ 22 strokes/minute</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between sets</p><p>Pace: 2km PR pace +16&nbsp;seconds</p><p>Rest 5 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 2 sets of</p><p>Row, 600 meters @ free rate</p><p>Rest 1 minute between sets</p><p>Pace: 2km PR pace + 7 seconds</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Start the session by rowing 3 sets of 1500 meters.

Continue by 2 sets of 600 meters, select your strokes for the 600-meter distances and try to achieve a 2km PR pace + 7 seconds. Ideally, your strokes should be powerful and at a moderately fast rate, consider that fewer strokes mean more power and more strokes mean more cardiovascular taxing. Row 500 meters at very light pressure as cool down.</p>
