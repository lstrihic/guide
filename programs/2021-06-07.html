Work on explosiveness. Focus on a powerful pull and a solid receiving position.

On the thrusters, ideally, go unbroken, alternatively, break into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. Move fast on the rope, find solid footings and squat to assist your upper body, descend by sliding down and jumping on the ground. Try to maintain a steady tempo throughout the session taking equal rest between rope climbs as you push through the total volume.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

Go with 8 deficit handstand push-ups + 16 single-leg squats + 75 double-unders + 12 + 24 + 75 + 16 + 32. Ideally, go the deficit handstand push-ups unbroken for as long as possible, if you feel that your midline breaks down, you are reaching muscle failure or your feet start being too wide, prefer to break, rest shortly and continue. Alternatively, break each round from the start into a big and a smaller set that will allow you to push efficiently through the reps. Go the single-leg squats at a steady sustainable tempo with focus on good reps.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Deficit —&gt; regular handstand push-ups</p><p>—</p><p></p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>AMRAP 30 Minutes of</p><p>30/23 calories, Row</p><p>20/15 calories, Bike-erg</p><p>10/8 calories, Ski-erg</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>It’s all about consistency. Maintain a steady pace on each erg, one that you can sustain throughout the whole session and focus on movement mechanics.
