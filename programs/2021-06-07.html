Try to achieve maximum performance in each one of them. Start by maintaining a fast steady pace, go each exercise unbroken with smooth transitions between and focus on breathing well, as you reach the end shorten your transitions and increase your pace to go for the strong finish. If going the barbell unbroken is not possible, prefer to break from the start into a big and a smaller set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>83/57kg – 180/125lb. —&gt; 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups —&gt; pull-ups</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

Ideally, go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps. If you know you are going to struggle make a plan to break into big manageable sets depending on your comfort. In the couplet start the round of 10 reps at a fast yet definitely manageable pace on the row/ski and similarly steady tempo on the burpees and try to maintain that pace throughout the portion.</p>
