Each rep is 1 Power Snatch + 1 Overhead Squat. Improve power and stability. Focus on a powerful pull, a proper reception and solid overhead squats. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between reps.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pulls</strong></p><p>4×3 @ 85% of Max Power Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pulls from where you left the power snatch &amp; overhead squat. Work on pulling strength. Focus on a slow, strong starting pull and an explosive shoulder shrug. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>60 strict handstand push-ups</p><p>45 deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155lb</p><p>60 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>45 deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155lb</p><p>Cap: 13 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This is a classic combination of handstand and deadlifts. The strict handstand push-ups make the total volume challenging. If you are comfortable on them break them up into a big and some smaller sets with short to minimum rest between. If not, prefer to break them up from the start into small sets with short rest between. If you overdo it on the strict you might reach early muscle failure and destroy your performance. Break the first portion of deadlifts into big manageable sets, ideally 10+ reps, that will allow you to push efficiently through the 45 reps. Use two marks to create a 10-meter distance to go back and forth until you complete the 60 meters (6×10), move fast with quick steps and good form.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Go the last portion of deadlifts unbroken for as long as possible, break only 2-3 reps before you feel like reaching failure.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Strict handstand push-ups <b>→</b> kipping handstand push-ups</p><p>102/70kg – 225/155lb <b>→</b> 83/55kg – 180/120lb</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> single arm dumbbell overhead lunges 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Make sure you maintain a proper form and reach full range of motion on the exercise, avoid half movements and excessive muscle pulls. Rope climbs play the most significant role, ascend fast and efficiently with solid squats on the rope. The more technical you are the better you will preserve your upper body and grips for both rope climbs and SDHP.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Pistols <b>→</b> goblet narrow squats</p><p>52/37kg – 115/80lb <b>→</b> 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.&nbsp;Row 4 Minutes @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A2. 3 sets of</p><p>1 Minute @ fast pace</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.&nbsp;Time Trial</p><p>750 meters </p><p>Rate: Over 28 strokes/minute</p><p>Pace: 1km PR pace – 3 seconds</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up by rowing 4 minutes at an easy pace as activation and 3 sets of 1 minute at a fast pace as priming for the main session. In the main session go for a 750-meter distance time trial. Give it all you got to complete the total distance as fast as possible. Consider that you should keep a high stroke rate (increased cardio) and still maintain a good, solid form. Cool down by rowing 4 minutes at very light pressure.</p>
