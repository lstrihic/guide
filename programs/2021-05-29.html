Lose no time between rope climbs, then take a breath and go for as many overhead squats as possible, if you break take minimum rest and continue. Ideally, If you are comfortable with barbells, attempt to squat snatch the barbell to the overhead. Though, it is recommended that you clean the barbell and place it on the back rack before you jerk it to the overhead position.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>83/52kg – 180/115lb. —&gt; 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>A. 2000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 2 sets of</p><p>3000 meters @ 4’10”-5’05”/km</p><p>Rest 7 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up by running 2000 meters prior to the main session and cool down running 400 meters afterwards at a comfortable pace of your choice.
