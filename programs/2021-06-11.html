Work on explosiveness and technique. Focus on fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>3×2 @ 90% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pull from where you left the squat clean.

Ideally, go the GHD sit-ups unbroken, alternatively, break the high-rep rounds into a big and a smaller set and push the low-rep rounds for unbroken. If you are comfortable with gymnastics try to go unbroken, if not, break from the start into no more than 2-3 sets with short rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups —&gt; pull-ups</p><p>*Go with pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 15 unbroken chest to bar pull-ups while fresh</p><p>Bar muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest to bar pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 8 unbroken bar muscle-ups while fresh.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 10.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1</p><p>Barbell dumbbell bench press 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb.</p><p>Double dumbbell bench prone row</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell bicep curls 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>15 double dumbbell push presses</p><p>20 meter, Overhead carry</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb —&gt; 20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>B. 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb —&gt; 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb. —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>20 double kettlebell snatches 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>20 strict ring dips</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>15 double kettlebell snatches 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>15 strict ring dips</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 double kettlebell snatches 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 strict ring dips</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>5 double kettlebell snatches 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>5 strict ring dips</p><p>10 meters, Front rack lunges 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>In this one reps of each exercise decrease with each round while meters remain equal. Break the double kettlebell snatches and the strict ring dips into no more than 2-3 manageable sets with short to minimum rest between. On the front rack lunges try to go the 10 meters unbroken each time. Push each exercise so far as form allows, focus on quality reps and not on fast time.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 20/12kg – 44/26lb.</p><p>Strict —&gt; kipping ring dips —&gt; ring push-ups</p><p>*Choose an option that you can perform at least 10 unbroken reps while fresh.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Rowing</strong></p><p>A.&nbsp;6 minutes @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.&nbsp;2 sets of</p><p>3750m @ 18-20 strokes/minute</p><p>Rest 2 minutes and 30 seconds</p><p>Pace: 2km PR pace + 18&nbsp;seconds</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up by rowing 6 minutes at an easy pace. In the main session, complete two medium distances at the given pace and slow steady strokes. Be technical, this is a low stroke rate that requires powerful pulls but will allow you to breathe well throughout and maintain form. Finish with 4 minutes rowing at very light pressure as cool down.</p>
