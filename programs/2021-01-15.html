Maintain a steady pace for the biggest part of the workout, 15+ minutes, and then start pushing harder shortening your transitions to go for the strong finish. Go the chest to bar pull-ups (ideally butterfly technique, alternatively kipping) and the toes to bar unbroken. Break the lunges into 2×7,5 meter unbroken distances, move steadily with focus on a solid overhead position (one dumbbell overhead, one dumbbell front rack). Perform the overhead squats with whichever arm you want, yet have in mind that you need to divide appropriately the volume between the two arms if you want to keep moving efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>8 double dumbbell power cleans 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb</p><p>15 meters, Front rack carry</p><p>8 double dumbbell squat cleans</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4 sets of</p><p>8-10 Arnold presses 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>10-12 tricep kickbacks</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>25/17,5kg – 55/40lb → 20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb → 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb → 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>10 rounds of</p><p>30 double-unders</p><p>4 parallettes handstand push-ups</p><p>3 sandbag cleans 70/50kg – 155/110lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and full range of motion.

In the second part go for 4 sets of 800 meters with free rate of strokes, and a goal pace at 2km PR pace. Keep in mind that fewer strokes need more power, more strokes need more cardio endurance.</p>
