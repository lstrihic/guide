Go the overhead squats unbroken for as long as possible, break 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching muscle failure and then continue with a few smaller sets, maintain a steady tempo on the bar-facing burpees over that will allow you to breathe and break the ring muscle-ups into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. The single arm dumbbell snatches are alternating, go at a fast, steady tempo and try to perform technical mid-air transitions. On the second round of burpees move at an equal or faster pace than in the first round, then catch a breath and go the last ring muscle ups unbroken for as long as possible.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Test your limits and push hard from the start. If you are comfortable with ring muscle-ups attempt to go the 15 reps unbroken far as long as possible, break just before failure and continue with the remaining reps, if not, prefer to break from the start into 2-3 manageable sets that will allow you to push efficiently through the reps. Go straight to the sandbag clean over shoulders and maintain a fast steady tempo, then catch a breath and go for an unbroken set of muscle-ups. Keep in mind that in any case you should keep your rest to the minimum possible. Ideally mark a 20-meter distance from the muscle-up spot to an imagery finish line.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>5km Test</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>In the first 1000 meters you should have already achieved your optimum pace, then maintain it steady and attempt to increase in the last 1000 meters!</p>
