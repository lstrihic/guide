Improve confidence and stability. Focus on an explosive push and a solid deep receiving position. If you have put work and are comfortable with split jerk go with that, if not go with push jerk. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets. Use racks or high blocks.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>15 toes to bar</p><p>15 overhead squats 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>Then,</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>15 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>15 power snatches 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>Cap: 11 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This workout consists of 2 consecutive couplets. In the first couplet, ideally go each exercise unbroken, alternatively break the toes to bar into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. Prefer to go the overhead squats unbroken at a steady, sustainable pace with controlled squats. In the second couplet, go each exercise unbroken with touch and go reps on the snatches. If you need to break choose either the chest to bar pull-ups or the snatches depending on your comfort with each exercise.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Do your best to complete each percentage unbroken with touch and go reps. Focus on proper form, utilise your legs to decompress your back and rest at the top of the deadlift if needed. You may have someone increasing weight on the bar for you. The use of weightlifting straps is highly recommended!</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>A.

Go the handstand walk by 10-meter unbroken distances, move fast with quick steps and proper handstand form (toes pointing upwards, solid midline). On the ring muscle ups go unbroken for as long as proper form allows, stop 2-3 reps before you feel like reaching failure rest shortly and continue with the remaining reps.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>60 <b>→</b> 45 <b>→</b> 30 meters of</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> 10 wall-walks</p><p>*Go with wall walks<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>if you can’t perform at least 7,5 unbroken meters handstand walk while fresh</p><p>20 <b>→</b> 15 <b>→</b> 10 reps of</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to ring pull-ups</p><p>**Choose a number of reps that you can perform unbroken while fresh.
