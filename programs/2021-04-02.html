Improve strength and confidence. Focus on a powerful push, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid receiving position. Ideally, if you have put work on split jerks go with that, if not, go with push jerks. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 15 Minutes of</p><p>15 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>4 ring muscle-ups</p><p>15 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>12 deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155 lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Move fast yet steadily for the biggest part of the workout, 10+ minutes, then start pushing harder by shortening your transitions to go for the strong finish. Break the handstand walk into 7,5 meter unbroken distances and go the ring muscle-ups and the deadlifts unbroken. If you find it hard to go the deadlifts unbroken break into a big and a smaller set with short rest between, in any case don’t hesitate to go with single lifts in order to keep moving efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand walk → 3 wall-walks</p><p>*Go with handstand walk if you can perform at least 7,5m unbroken while fresh</p><p>Ring muscle-ups → chest to rings pull-ups</p><p>*Go with ring muscle-ups if you can perform 2 unbroken reps while fresh</p><p>102/70kg – 225/155 lb → 80/52kg – 175/115lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

In the main session row in the first part at steady 22 strokes and the given pace, be consistent and try to achieve equal performance in each set, in the second part of the main session focus on finding the perfect stroke rate that will allow you breath well and manage powerful pulls as you work at the given pace. Cool down rowing 2 minutes at very light pressure.</p>
