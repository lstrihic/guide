The lifts at 70% are 2 times of 2 push press + 2 jerks, at 85% 1 time of 1 push press + 2 jerks. Improve explosiveness (push presses) and technique (jerk). Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 15 Minutes of</p><p>Buy in:</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>21 toes to bar</p><p>21 wall-balls 9/6kg – 20/14lb</p><p>Then,</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>7 power cleans 82/52 – 180/115lb</p><p>7 bar muscle-ups</p><p>Then,</p><p>Max distance, Bike-erg</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Start the workout with the 2 couplets and then go for as much distance as possible on the bike. In the first couplet ideally go each exercise unbroken with smooth transitions between, alternatively break the toes to bar into a big and a smaller set (e.g 11-10) with short to minimum rest between. In the second couplet go the power cleans with single lifts at a fast, steady tempo, ideally go the bar muscle-ups unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set (e.g 4-3). On the bike find a fast yet sustainable pace, keep in mind that the more the remaining time the steadier your pace should be, the less the remaining time the faster.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>82/52 – 180/115lb <b>→</b> 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>Bar muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>9 double kettlebell deadlifts 32/20kg – 70/44lb</p><p>7 double kettlebell cleans</p><p>5 double kettlebell shoulder to overhead</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 plate bicep curls 25/15kg<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>– 55/35lb</p><p>12 Bradford presses 43/34kg – 95/75lb</p><p>15 plate lateral raises 2,5kg – 5lb</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 32/20kg – 70/44lb → 24/16kg – 53/35lb → 20/12kg – 44/26lb</p><p>B. 25/15kg<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>– 55/35lb → 20/10kg – 45/25lb</p><p>43/34kg – 95/75lb → 34/25kg – 75/55lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>13 deficit handstand push-ups 20/10cm – 8/4” (plates)</p><p>Then,</p><p>42.30.18 reps of</p><p>Double kettlebell deadlifts 32/24kg – 70/53lb</p><p>Box jump-overs 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>Then,</p><p>30 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and quality of movements. Ideally go the deficit handstand push-ups unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short rest between then go straight to the deadlifts. On the deadlifts make a plan to break into a big and no more than 2-3 smaller sets with short to minimum rest between. Go the box jump-overs at a steady manageable pace and push harder as reps decrease with each round. Break the handstand walk into 7,5 meters unbroken distances, move fast with short yet adequate rest between distances that will allow you to achieve the unbroken.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Deficit <b>→</b> regular handstand push-ups</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> 8 wall-walks</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.

The goal in the main session is to efficiently increase your strokes and pace with each part. In the B1 part keep steady 20 strokes and try to achieve a 2km PR pace +18 seconds, in the B2 part 22 strokes and 2km PR pace +16 seconds and in the B3 part 24 strokes and 2km PR pace + 10 seconds. Cool down by rowing 4 minutes at very light pressure.</p>
