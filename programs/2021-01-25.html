Improve explosiveness and stability. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position. The lightweight high-rep set allows you to work on proper angles and quality. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>A.

The mechanics are different for each part so don’t hesitate to push them both hard. Ideally go the gymnastic exercises unbroken, alternatively break the first two rounds into a big and a smaller set with short rest between and go the last round unbroken for as long as possible. The strategy is on the lifts, start each round of power cleans with a big set and if you break continue immediately with single lifts until you complete the reps. Try to go the shoulders to overhead unbroken with efficient touch and go jerks for as long as possible. Focus on technique, a steady tempo and proper angles.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>52/37kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>Pull-ups</p><p><b>Scale</b></p><p>43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p>Knees raises – pull-ups (band)</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

The goal is to push efficiently through the muscle-ups. Maintain a steady, strictly sustainable pace on the ski, the 500-meter distance should be considerably faster than the 1000-meter distance. Ideally, go the first round of muscle-ups with a big and a smaller set with short rest between, alternatively break into a few manageable sets. Go the second round of muscle-ups unbroken for as long as proper form allows.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ski-erg <b>→</b> row <b>→</b> run</p><p>20 <b>→</b> 15 <b>→</b> 10 reps of</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to rings pull-ups</p><p>10 <b>→</b> 8 <b>→</b> 6 reps on 2nd set</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.

The volume is increasing so make sure you don’t start too hard and reach an early failure. Try to move steadily and breath well throughout the session. Maintain a steady pace on the assault-bike, 65RPM for men / 57RPM for women. Go the double-unders unbroken, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> bike-erg <b>→</b> row</p>
