On the bar facing burpees maintain a fast yet sustainable tempo, make sure every rep takes the same time and is identical to the previous one. Ideally work on an echo bike, alternatively an assault bike. Start steadily on the bike and increase your pace as you push throughout the cals, less time means faster increase, more time steadier increase.</p>
