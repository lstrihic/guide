Create a working space that will make it easier for you to move from exercise to exercise. Go the double dumbbell thrusters unbroken and the box jumps at a fast, sustainable pace (ideally touch &amp; go). Prefer to break the strict handstand push-ups from the start into sets of 6-4 or 5-5 reps that will allow you to move efficiently through the total volume. As you reach the finish go for unbroken handstand push-ups and try to minimise your transitions.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15g – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>Strict <b>→</b> kipping handstand push-ups</p><p>*go with strict if you can perform easily 10 unbroken reps while fresh</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps. Ideally go the deadlifts and the shoulders to overhead unbroken, alternatively break into a big and smaller set with minimum rest between. If you are to choose between the two exercises, prefer to break the deadlifts and push the shoulder to overhead for the unbroken. Take short yet adequate rest between exercises that will allow you to move efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>70/47,5kg – 154/105lb → 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>10 rounds of</p><p>1 leg-less rope climb</p><p>3 metal parallettes handstand push-ups</p><p>10 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on quality of movements and full range of motion.

Go the leg-less rope climbs with proper upper-lower body coordination, preferably leg kicks or kipping. Take a moment to boost your confidence and perform 3 solid handstand push-ups, then without much hesitation continue with the handstand walk. Move fast with short and quick steps, ideally going the 10 meters unbroken, alternatively by 2×5 meters unbroken.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Leg-less → regular</p><p>Metal parallettes —&gt; deficit on plates (15/10cm) → regular handstand push-ups</p><p>10 → 7,5 → 5 meters of</p><p>Handstand walk* → 2 wall-walk</p><p>*Choose an option that you can perform unbroken for a whole round while fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.
