Work on explosiveness and technique. Focus on fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep overhead position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pull</strong></p><p>3×2 @ 90% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pull from where you left the squat snatch.

Push fast through the ski meters but surely not at max effort, then go straight to the legless rope climb. Use your legs (kicks or kipping) to assist your upper body and descend smoothly by sliding down, extending your body and jumping on the ground. Take a breath each time before the overhead squats, prefer to clean and swifty position on the back rack and jerk. Focus on unbroken sets and controlled squats with a solid overhead position .</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Leg-less —&gt; regular rope climbs</p><p>83/61kg – 180/135lb. —&gt; 70/52kg – 155/115lb. —&gt; 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>12 goblet kettlebell narrow squats 20/16kg – 44/35lb.</p><p>10 weighted dips on parallel bars</p><p>Rest 60 seconds between sets</p><p></p><p>B. 5.10.15.10.5 reps of</p><p>Bent over double dumbbell row 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>Double dumbbell arnold presses</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>20/16kg – 44/35lb. 16/12kg – 35/26lb.</p><p>15/10kg – 35/22,5lb<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>—&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strongman Stamina</strong></p><p>EMOM 20 Minutes of</p><p>Odd: 3 bench press @ 85%</p><p>Even: 10 meters, Heavy farmers walk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>In every odd minute complete 3 bench presses, in every even minute complete a 10-meter unbroken distance farmer walk.

Be super explosive on the assault bike and push swiftly through the calories, 72+/63+ RPM for women. Ideally go the bar muscle ups unbroken, alternatively if you are not comfortable with the exercise prefer to break from the start into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between. In this way you will plan how much time you need without over-trying and risking losing additional time. Then go straight to the burpees, the goal is to maintain the fastest possible pace. Go for an attempt of 1 minute max-rep burpees prior to the session and then try to maintain 90% of that pace in the session.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Bar muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest to bar pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 8 unbroken bar muscle-ups while fresh.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>A. 2000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 2 sets of</p><p>4000 meters @ 4’15”-5’20”/km</p><p>Rest 7 minutes between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up by running 2000 meters prior to the main session and cool down for 1000 meters afterwards at a comfortable pace of your choice.
