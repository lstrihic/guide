Improve power. The lifts at 60% are 2 power cleans + 1 push press, at 80% are 2 times of 2 power cleans + 1 push press. Go with single power cleans, rest no less than 90 seconds between sets (times), no more than 15 seconds between power cleans.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>5 rounds of</p><p>60 double-unders</p><p>12 deadlifts 83/57kg – 185/125lb.</p><p>9 hang power cleans 83/57kg – 185/125lb.</p><p>6 shoulders to overhead 83/57kg – 185/125lb.</p><p>Cap: 15 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to go each round equally fast. Go the double-unders unbroken and try to be as efficient as you can with the barbell. A good way to go is by 11 deadlifts, 1 deadlift + 8 hang power cleans, 1 hang power clean + 6 shoulders to overhead. Consider that the most difficult part will be the hang power cleans. Perform fast reps and try to remain as less as possible on the hang position and avoid taxing your grips and upper body more than needed.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>83/57kg – 185/125lb. —&gt; 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 double kettlebell box step-overs 32/20kg – 70/44lb.</p><p>20 meters, Double kettlebell front rack carry</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 2.4.8.4.2 reps of</p><p>Double dumbbell bicep curls 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>Double dumbbell see-saw presses</p><p>Double dumbbell high pulls</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>32/20kg – 70/44lb. —&gt; 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>15/10kg – 35/22,5lb. —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>45 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>18 double dumbbell step-ups over 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. , 61/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>30 strict handstand push-ups</p><p>45 meters, Shoulders rack lunges 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and full range of motion. Ideally, break the handstand walk and the shoulders rack lunges into 7,5-meter distances. Go the step-ups unbroken for as long as proper form allows, if you break take short to minimum rest and continue with the remaining reps. Break the handstand push ups form the start into small manageable sets with short rest between that will allow you to keep moving efficiently. Move steadily on the lunges with focus on a solid front rack position.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand walk —&gt; 9 wall-walks</p><p>Strict —&gt; kipping handstand push-ups</p><p>*Go with kipping if you can’t perform at least 10 unbroken strict handstand push-ups</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/25lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.&nbsp;Row 4 Minutes @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A2. 3 sets of</p><p>1 Minute @ fast pace</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.&nbsp;Time Trial 750 meters </p><p>Rate: Over 28 strokes/minute</p><p>Pace: 1km PR pace – 3 seconds</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up rowing 4 minutes at an easy pace and continue with 3 times of 1 minute at a really fast pace to prime your cardio.

Row 4 minutes at super light pressure as cool down.</p>
