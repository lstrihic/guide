Work on technique and explosiveness. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid bottom position. The lightweight sets allow you to really focus on technique and quality. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pull</strong></p><p>3×3 @ 95% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pulls from where you left the squat snatches. Work on pulling strength. Focus on a slow, strong starting pull and an explosive finish. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>3 sets of</p><p>AMRAP 7 Minutes of</p><p>3.6.9.12..etc reps of</p><p>Thrusters*</p><p>Toes to bar</p><p>Rest 3 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to achieve high performance in each set. Each set is a 7-minute AMRAP in which you have to complete a couplet of increasing reps by 3. Increase the load on the bar for the thrusters as prescribed. Go unbroken on both exercises on the low-rep rounds and as reps increase start breaking into manageable sets with short to minimum rest between. The faster your transitions are between rounds and exercises the better your performance will be.</p><p>*The load of each set is:</p><p>1st set: 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>2nd set: 52/37kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>3rd set: 43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

Focus on kipping technique and try to maintain a steady tempo that will allow you to keep pushing without falling down.

It’s all about consistency, go the first calories and burpees of each AMRAP at a fast yet manageable pace then go straight to the Max calories set maintaining a steady sustainable pace until the last second. Make sure you breathe well throughout and avoid pushing too hard too early. Consider that as time cap and cals/reps decrease with each part, your effort should be progressively increased.</p><p>The reccommended pace is:</p><p>A. 65 RPM for men / 57 RPM for women</p><p>B. 68 RPM for men / 60 RPM for women</p><p>C. 71+ RPM<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>for men / 63+ RPM for women</p>
