Improve pulling strength and weightlifting angles. Start slowly and move explosively once the barbell is over the knees, bring the barbell as high as possible. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>24/18 calories, Row</p><p>12 clean and jerks 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>12 box jump-overs 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>Cap: 13 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Move steadily in the first 2 rounds, push the last round hard.
