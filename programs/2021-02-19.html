Improve explosiveness and technique. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pull</strong></p><p>3×2 @ 90% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pulls from where you left the squat snatches. Work on pulling strength and technique (proper angles on the second pull). Focus on a slow, strong starting pull, once the barbell is over the knees increase your speed and finish with an explosive second pull to an almost standing position. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>33.27.21.15.9 reps of</p><p>Deadlifts 83/55kg – 180/120lb</p><p>Handstand push-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The descending reps give you the psychological advantage, make sure you keep pushing until the last second. Ideally break both exercises of the high-rep rounds (33, 27 reps) into a big unbroken set and some smaller sets (5-10 reps) with short rest between and go the lower-rep rounds (21, 15, 9 reps) unbroken for as long as possible breaking each exercise 2-3 reps before reaching failure. Alternatively break all rounds into a big and some smaller manageable sets with short rest between that will allow you to keep moving efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>83/55kg – 180/120lb <b>→ </b>61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>Handstand push-ups <b>→</b> push-ups hand release</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Ideally go both exercises unbroken with smooth transitions between that will allow you to push through the total volume efficiently. Depending on your comfort on gymnastics or weights choose an exercise to go faster into. e.g if you are strong prefer to go straight from handstand walk to the kettlebells and smoothly from the kettlebells to the handstand walk, if you are good on gymnastics do the opposite.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb <b>→</b> 20/12kg – 44/26lb</p><p>10 <b>→</b> 7,5* <b>→</b> 5* meters of</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> 2 wall-walks</p><p>*Choose a distance that you can easily perform unbroken while fresh </p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A. 2 sets of&nbsp;</p><p>Row, 500 meters @ 24 strokes/minute</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B1.&nbsp;4 sets of</p><p>Row, 1250 meters @ 24 strokes/min</p><p>Rest 2 minutes + 30 seconds&nbsp;</p><p>Pace: 2km PR pace + 12 seconds</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rest 5 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B2.

In the main session try to achieve high and equal performance in each set, maintain a 2km PR pace + 12 seconds and make sure you keep 24 steady strokes. Finish the session with a 400-meter sprint, give it all you got to finish as fast as you can, strokes are free. Cool down rowing 500 meters at very light pressure.</p>
