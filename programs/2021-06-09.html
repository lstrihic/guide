Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as you can, if you break take minimum rest and immediately continue with the remaining reps. Ideally, go each exercise unbroken with a possible fast break on the deadlifts and fast transitions between exercises. If this is not possible, break from the start each round of either deadlifts or ring muscle-ups into no more than 2-3 manageable sets with minimum rest between depending on which exercise you struggle most. In any case push the last round for unbroken.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>102/70kg – 225/155lb. —&gt; 83/61kg – 180/135lb.</p><p>Ring muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest to bar pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 5 unbroken ring muscle-ups while fresh.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 3 sets of</p><p>12 weighted double kettlebell cossack squats (6 each side) 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 double kettlebell swings</p><p>8 double kettlebell shoulder to overhead</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 2 sets of</p><p>60 seconds, Hollow hold</p><p>30 seconds, Right side plank hold</p><p>30 seconds, Left side plank hold</p><p>Then</p><p>2 rounds of</p><p>60 seconds, Plank hold</p><p>20 plank hip dips</p><p>15 arch rocks</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 20/12kg – 44/26lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Back Squat</strong></p><p>1×2 @ 50%</p><p>1×2 @ 60%</p><p>1×2 @ 65%</p><p>1×2 @ 70%</p><p>1×2 @ 75%</p><p>5×1 @ 80% (EMOM)</p><p>1×5 @ 65% fast pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up with set of 3 reps until you reach 50%.

Go smoothly and under control into a handstand position and then try to maintain it for as long as you can with focus on a straight body with toes pointing upwards, a tight midline and shoulder-arms tight and extended. The game winner is the fingers, if you achieve the previous position then it’s the fingers that will assist you to balance efficiently.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics Strength</strong></p><p>5 Reps Max of</p><p>Weighted strict pull-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and full range of motion.

Move fast through the triplet. Go the double-unders unbroken, push explosively through the calories on the assault bike and go straight to the bar-facing burpees over. Make sure you pace the burpees at a steady sustainable tempo throughout the session. On the max calories start powerfully and then maintain the momentum for as long as you can. Don’t push each set too hard, aim at a consistent performance.</p>
