Maintain a fast yet manageable pace on the first ski, box-jumps over and run that will allow you to breathe and break the power cleans of the 1st part (before farmers carry) into a big and 1-2 smaller touch &amp; go sets with minimum rest between. Then move fast and efficiently on the rope finding solid footings to squat and assist your upper body as much as possible. In the 2nd part move in the same fashion yet make sure you maintain an equal or faster tempo than in the 1st part.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Accessory Work</b></p><p>A.

Stroke rate is free, keep in mind that fewer strokes require more powerful pulls while more strokes cause more cardiovascular tax. Prefer to start with fewer strokes and, if needed, increase throughout the distances.</p><p><b>Cool down</b></p><p>4 minutes @ very light pressure.</p>
