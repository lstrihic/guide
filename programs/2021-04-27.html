The lifts at 60% are 3 squat cleans + 2 jerks, the lifts at 90% are 5 times of 1 squat clean + 1 jerk. Work on confidence and maximal strength. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts. Prefer to work on split jerks, the loads are heavy so it’s your chance to work on split jerk stability.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>3×3 @ 95% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pulls from where you left the squat clean and jerks. Improve pulling strength. Start slowly and move explosively once the barbell is over the knees. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>4 rounds of</p><p>2 rope climbs 4,6m – 15ft</p><p>12 double dumbbell shoulders to overhead 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>2 rope climbs 4,6m – 15ft</p><p>12 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>20 meters, Sandbag bear hug carry 70/50kg – 155/115lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to move fast and efficiently on the rope and move at a steady tempo on the other exercises. Find solid footings on the rope to squat and assist your upper body, consider that there is high volume of rope climbing so the more technical you are the better you will perform throughout. Ideally, go the shoulders to overhead unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set. It is recommended that you try to go the 12-meters handstand walk and 20 meters sandbag bear hug carry unbroken. Find that solid hug carry position that will allow you to go unbroken, in any case if you feel you are struggling to complete the distances break into 6-meter and 10-meter distances respectively.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/25lb.</p><p>Handstand walk —&gt; 3 wall-walks</p><p>Sandbag —&gt; d-ball carry or dual kb front rack 24/16kg – 53/35lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Ideally, go each exercise unbroken with smooth transitions between them. Alternatively break the thrusters into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. Work with the heavy rope and try to push efficiently through the thrusters. If you need to rest prefer to briefly catch your breath with the barbell overhead.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Heavy —&gt; 100 regular rope double-unders</p><p>43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p>52/27kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>100 push-ups</p><p>75 GHD sit-ups</p><p>50 push-ups</p><p>25 GHD sit-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on form and full range of motion.
