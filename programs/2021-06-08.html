Prefer to work on split jerks. Focus on an explosive push and a deep split receiving position. Repositioning the barbell smoothly on the shoulders is also important, make sure you keep in control. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shoulders Press</strong></p><p>3×10 @ 60%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up with an empty barbell and increase weight with sets of 5 reps until you reach 50%. Improve strength and muscle quality. Focus on a strict push without utilising your hips and legs. In order to push through each set efficiently you need to have a proper front rack position with the barbell resting on the shoulders and not on the arms. Rest no more than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>A.

Reps seem to decrease with each portion yet rounds increase so volume is the same with emphasis given to the lifts. Move fast and explosively every time you are on the rower and go the toes to bar unbroken. The challenge is the snatches. Go the lightweight snatches with a big set of touch and go reps and continue with fast singles (minimum rest between). On the heavier loads prefer to go with single lifts at a fast tempo by lifting the bar as soon as it stabilizes on the ground.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 61/43kg – 135/95lb. —&gt; 52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p>B. 70/52kg – 155/115lb. —&gt; 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>C. 83/61kg – 180/135lb. —&gt; 70/52kg – 155/115lb.</p><p>—</p><p></p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Start the session by completing 50 for men/35 for women calories on the bike, maintain a fast pace, 68+/55+ RPM then go straight to the lifts. It is recommended that you push through the lifts with drop &amp; go technique. Perform single lifts with minimum rest between. Focus on 2 things, 1st maintain a steady tempo throughout, resting time of heavier lifts should be as equal as possible to that of lighter lifts, 2nd perform fast weight increases, make sure it doesn’t get you too long to continue to the heavier weight.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics Complex</strong></p><p>3 sets of</p><p>1.2.3..etc reps of</p><p>Strict ring pull-ups</p><p>Strict ring muscle-ups</p><p>Strict ring dips</p><p>Rest as needed betweens sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Each set is a complex which you have to go unbroken.
