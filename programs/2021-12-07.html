Ideally start the clean &amp; jerks with a touch &amp; go set, the size of the set depends on your comfort with the barbell, and switch to solid single lifts once you notice that touch and go technique is not efficient anymore or impedes your performance. Continue to the squat cleans with single lifts at the same steady tempo and once you complete the squat cleans catch a short breath and go for an unbroken set of thrusters. Alternatively, go from the start with single lifts and break the thrusters into no more than 2-3 sets with minimum rest between.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>83/52kg – 185/115lb. —&gt;70/43kg – 155/95lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Engine – Running</b></p><p>Every 2 Minutes for 40 Minutes (20 sets)</p><p>200 meters @ 37”-55”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>15 Minutes @ easy pace</p><p><b>Goal &amp; Pace</b></p><p>Go for a finish ideally within 45 seconds in each set, working up to 95-97% of Vo2max.
