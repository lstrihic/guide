Go all reps with single lifts. Try to maintain a solid tempo with equal rest (short to minimum) between lifts. The better you manage to keep your rest short and your tempo steady the better your performance will be. Loading the barbell is on you so be fast and efficient during the weight increases.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>2 rounds of</p><p>60 wall-balls 9/6kg – 20/14lb</p><p>40 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>20 ring muscle-ups</p><p>Cap: 17 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Be consistent, prefer to pace the first round and push the second round harder. In the first round break the wall-balls and the chest to bar pull-ups into a big and no more than 2-3 smaller sets with short rest between. Do the same for the ring muscle-ups and don’t hesitate to break into even smaller and more manageable sets, you don’t want to push the first muscle ups too hard and leave the tank without gas. In the second round go each exercise unbroken for as long as possible. Always make sure you break 1-2 reps before failure, rest shortly and continue pushing. Try to breathe well during the wall-balls and be very technical on the gymnastics. The more technical you are the better you will perform under fatigue in the second round.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups (go with pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 15 unbroken chest to bar pull-ups when fresh)</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> ring dips (go with ring dips if you can’t perform at least 8 unbroken ring muscle-ups while fresh)</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A.

Alternatively, break the high-rep rounds (20, 25) into no more than 2-3 manageable sets. On the handstand push-ups focus on fast, efficient reps with proper kipping technique.</p><p>*Make sure your reps accord to the Open standards — Mark the height of your wrists, then measure down 3 inches and create a line on the wall. Each handstand push-up begins and ends with the heels in contact with the wall and above the pre-marked line.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>GHD sit-ups <b>→</b> toes to rings <b>→</b> weighted sit-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>3 sets of</p><p>AMRAP 12 Minutes of</p><p>35/25 calories, Assault bike</p><p>25 burpees over row (lateral)</p><p>Max distance, Row</p><p>Rest 5 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to achieve maximum performance between sets.

Once you have completed the couplet go straight to the Row. Maintain a progressively increased pace, the less the remaining time the faster the increase should be, the more the remaining time the steadier the increase.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> row</p>
