Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets.</p><p><b>Movements</b></p><p>Focus on a powerful pull, a solid front rack receiving position and a strong push press. Make sure you utilise your legs to push the barbell overhead and create momentum before you continue with your shoulders.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Conditioning</b></p><p>AMRAP 15 Minutes of</p><p>5 clean and jerks 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>10 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>15 box-jumps 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>2-3 rounds of</p><p>5 clean and jerks 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>7 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>9 box-jumps</p><p><b>Goal</b></p><p>The goal is to move constantly and efficiently through the 15 minutes. Maintain a fast yet manageable pace for the biggest part of the workout, 10+ minutes, then if possible increase your pace and go for the strong finish.</p><p><b>Movements</b></p><p>Prefer to go the clean &amp; jerks with single lifts but make sure you take minimum rest between lifts, go the chest to bar pull-ups unbroken and the box-jumps at a steady, sustainable pace (ideally touch and go). The key is to keep equal transitions between exercises and throughout the workout, the more you are able to keep them fast and equal the better your performance will be. As you reach the finish shorten your transitions and go for touch &amp; go lifts to push yourself to your limits.</p><p><b>Scale</b></p><p>Clean and jerks 52/37kg – 115/80lb → 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>Pull-ups → assisted pull-ups (band)</p><p>Step-ups 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Accessory Work</b></p><p>A.
