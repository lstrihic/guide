Focus on form and technique. Go for a solid steady position with the barbell below the knees, count 2 full seconds before you continue your pull. Prefer to practice power jerks.

Pace the high-cal rounds of the ski and push harder on the low-cal rounds (be more explosive in each next round). On the deadlifts break the high-rep rounds into a big and some smaller sets with short to minimum rest between and go the low-rep rounds unbroken for as long as you can. Run at a fast yet sustainable pace between rounds that will allow you to regulate your breathing.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ski-erg —&gt; row</p><p>102/70kg – 225/155lb. —&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>83/61kg – 185/135lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.
