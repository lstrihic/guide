In each part you have to achieve maximum performance. The challenge in the AMRAP is to move fast and constantly, go each exercise unbroken and the box jumps at a fast steady pace. Consider your performance will depend on the transitions, the more you succeed in keeping short transitions between exercises the better your score will be. Next you will be given 6 minutes to find a 1rep max. Spend about 2 minutes to rest and then start your lifts at about 87% of your Max, you will have time for 3 or 4 lifts at best.
