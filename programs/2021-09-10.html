Pace the exercises until you complete the 10 rope climbs and then start pushing harder up to a near max effort pace. Break the single arm dumbbell overhead lunges into 10-meter unbroken distances and go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break catch a really short breath and immediately continue with the remaining reps. If you are comfortable with wall-balls, try to go the first portion unbroken and the second portion unbroken for as long as possible, if not, prefer to break the first portion into a big and 1-2 smaller sets and try to go the second portion unbroken for as long as possible. On the rope climbs maintain a tempo that will allow fast an efficient ascents, make sure you use your legs to squat on the rope and descent smoothly by sliding down, extending your body and jumping on the ground.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>32,5/22,5kg – 70/50lb —&gt; 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Accessory Work</b></p><p>A. 6.12.18.24 reps of</p><p>Double kettlebell cossack squats 16/12kg – 35/26lb.</p><p>Double kettlebell cyclist squats</p><p>Double kettlebell calf raises</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell renegade rows 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>8 double dumbbell Arnold presses</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>A. 6.12.18.24 –&gt; 6.12.18. reps of&nbsp;</p><p>16/12kg – 35/26lb. —&gt; 12/8kg – 26/18lb. —&gt; bodyweight</p><p>B. 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb. —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Strength/Gymnastics</b></p><p>For form</p><p>10 parallettes handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>20 double dumbbell step-overs 61/50cm – 24/20” | 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>10 parallettes<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>15 double dumbbell step-overs 61/50cm – 24/20” | 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>10 parallettes handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>10 double dumbbell step-overs 61/50cm – 24/20” | 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>10 parallettes handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>5 double dumbbell step-overs 61/50cm – 24/20” | 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>20 shoulder taps</p><p>6 step-overs</p><p>10 handstand push-ups</p><p>4 double dumbbell step-overs</p><p>5 parallette handstand push-ups</p><p><b>Goal</b></p><p>Focus on proper form and full range of motion.
