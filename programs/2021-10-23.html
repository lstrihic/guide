Go the box jumps at a steady sustainable pace. Ideally, go the hang power cleans and shoulder to overhead unbroken and try to regulate your breathing during the box jumps. If this is not possible prefer to go each round with 9 hang power cleans, 1 hang power clean + 5 shoulder to overhead. Once you complete the AMRAP you have 6 minutes to find a 1RM Jerk. You can use racks or high blocks.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Accessory Work</b></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>8 single arm suitcase dumbbell deadlifts 30/22,5kg – 65/50lb</p><p>7 single-arm dumbbell bench rows</p><p>6 single arm dumbbell push presses</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>*switch arms with each set</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 double kettlebell swings 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>20 push-ups</p><p>10 double kettlebell snatches</p><p>Rest 60 seconds between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>30/22,5kg – 65/50lb —&gt; 25/15kg – 55/35lb</p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 16/12kg – 35/26lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Bench Press</b></p><p>Daily Max</p><p>Then</p><p>3×8 @ 70%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>3×8 bench presses @ 20/15kg barbell</p><p><b>Goal</b></p><p>Build up to a heavy lift for the day with sets of 3-4 reps &lt; 60%, 2-3 reps &lt; 80 and single lifts &gt; 80%.
