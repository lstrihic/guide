In the main session try to achieve maximum performance in each set. The goal is to maintain on both sets a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>2km PR pace + 18&nbsp;seconds. Select strokes within the given stroke rate in order to achieve that. Remember that the faster the strokes the more the cardiovascular taxing, the fewer the strokes the more powerful the pulls need to be. This is a low stroke/rate so you gotta need to pull hard. Cool down rowing 4 minutes at super light pressure.</p>
