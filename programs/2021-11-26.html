The goal is to pace the part before the rope climbs and then push to maintain the same or faster pace in the next part (after rope climbs).</p><p><b>Movements</b></p><p>Go the front rack lunges unbroken (5-meter unbroken mandatory section) and break the hang power cleans into a big and 1-2 smaller sets with short rest between, the fewer times you drop the barbell on the hang the better. Push fast through the ski and break the wall-balls into a big and a smaller set. In the second portion (after rope climbs) try to go unbroken or achieve the same sets and transitions as in the first part. On the rope climbs move fast finding solid footing and squat on the rope to assist your upper body. Descend smoothly by sliding down, extending your body and jumping on the ground.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Accessory Work</b></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 weighted single-leg squats 20/12kg – 44/26lb.</p><p>12 rotational kettlebell swings</p><p>Rest 75 seconds between sets</p><p>*switch arm in each set</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>9 double kettlebell push presses 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>15 meters, Double dumbbell overhead carry</p><p>21 double dumbbell Romanian deadlifts</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 20/12kg – 44/26lb. —&gt; 16/8kg – 35/18lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Strength/Gymnastics</b></p><p>For form</p><p>15.10.5 reps of</p><p>Parallettes handstand push-ups 20/15cm – 10/8”</p><p>20 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>40 meters, Double kettlebell farmers walk 32/24kg – 70/53lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>4.8.12 reps of</p><p>Hand release push-ups</p><p>Double kettlebell deadlifts 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>10 meters, Bear walk</p><p><b>Goal &amp; Movements</b></p><p>Ideally, go the parallettes handstand push-ups unbroken, alternatively, break the high-rep round into a big and a smaller set and push the low-rep rounds harder.
