Improve confidence and stability. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell, an explosive push on the jerk and solid receiving positions. Go with split jerks. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>4×1 @ 100% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pull from where you stopped the squat clean and jerk.

The goal is to slightly pace until you complete the ring muscle-ups and then start pushing harder to go for a strong finish. On the first ski maintain a pace at 1:52.0-1:57.0 for men and 2:02.0-2:07.0 form women, go all the wall-balls unbroken and all the box-jumps at a steady sustainable tempo. If you are not comfortable with wall-balls prefer to break the first round and push the second round for unbroken. Ideally go the ring muscle-ups unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Finish the workout with a near max effort pace on the ski.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest to bar pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 3 unbroken reps of ring muscle-ups while fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 14.12.10.8.6.4 reps of</p><p>Kettlebell snatches 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>Kettlebell overhead squats</p><p>(in each round half with right arm, half with left arm)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4 sets of</p><p>12 double dumbbell overhead presses 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>8 double dumbbell hammer curls</p><p>Rest 60 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt;16/12kg – 35/26lb</p><p>15/10kg – 35/22,5lb. —&gt;10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yoke Carry</strong></p><p>Built to a heavy 10-meter unbroken distance</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up with an empty yoke and progressively add weight until you reach the max load with which you can complete 10-meters unbroken. Do not go all sets by 10-meter distances, go with 5 meters and increase to 10 when you estimate that the load on the yoke is challenging. If you don’t have a yoke, work with a barbell and racks.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Max Effort</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>30/23 calories, Assault bike</p><p>12 cleans 93/61kg – 205/135lb.</p><p>Cap: 3 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Give everything you got from the start. Push explosively through the calories on the assault bike and go straight to the barbell. Go with single lifts with minimum rest between and if you feel confident enough finish the last reps with a touch and go set. You can go with either power or clean squats so start with power but if you can’t continue immediately switch to squat. in this way you avoid resting too much to go for a power clean or making a failed power clean attempt.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>93/61kg – 205/135lb. —&gt; 83/54kg – 185/120lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>1000 meters @ 5’’00”-6’00”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’50”-5’50”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’40”-5’40”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’30”-5’30”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’20”-5’20”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’10”-5’10”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ Max effort</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run a total distance of 7000 meters. When competing against others its important to be able to finish strong after a long run and that is what is needed in this one. Increase pace in each 1000 meter distance (select a pace depending on your level), progressively increase your heart and respiratory rate and when you reach the last 1000 meters push your limits, near the VO2 max, and go for the strong finish.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>1000 <b>—&gt;</b><b> </b>800 <b>—&gt;</b><b> </b>600 meters @ given paces</p>
