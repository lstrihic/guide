Start with touch &amp; go sets and if you find that you can’t sustain proper t&amp;g technique switch to single lifts. Consider this session slightly as a For time workout, work on the weight increases and make sure you load the bar fast and effectively, use the time to rest but don’t overdo it, take just as much rest as needed.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Engine</b></p><p>A1.
