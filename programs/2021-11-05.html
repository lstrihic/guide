Then go the farmers walk distance by 20 or 10-meter unbroken distances depending on the available space, ideally go unbroken for as long as possible. In the 2nd part go the exercises unbroken for as long as you can, break only 1-2 reps before your feel like reaching muscle failure and push the rower really hard.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>Ring muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest.
