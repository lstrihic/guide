Warm up with an empty barbell and progressively increase weight until you reach 65%, go with sets of 2 reps. Work on the hang position and technique. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell, a solid deep squat and front rack position. Try to spend minimum time at the hang position, adding the less possible pressure to your back and grips. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull from blocks</strong></p><p>1×3 @ 95% of Max Hang Squat Clean</p><p>1×3 @ 100%</p><p>2×3 @ 105%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pulls from where you left the hang squat snatches.

Go the squat snatches with single lifts, try to maintain a steady pace with minimum rest between lifts. The better you manage equal rest between light lifts and heavy lifts the better your performance will be. Ideally go the ring muscle-ups unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller sets with short to minimum rest between. Increase weight on the barbell on your own.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>Squat snatches 61/43kg – 135/95l all sets</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.
