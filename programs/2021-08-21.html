Avoid going too hard in the first rounds, break into really manageable sets (ideally no more than 3-4 sets for presses, 2-3 sets for muscle ups) with short to minimum rest between and try to keep your upper body fresh and going. As you reach the finish push harder, specifically in the last round try to go each exercise unbroken for as long as possible. Break 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching failure. The more technical you are on the muscle-ups, the less you tax your body and the better you are able to push through the workout.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb → 52/37kg – 115/75lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Engine</b></p><p>6 rounds of</p><p>Run, 5 minutes @ easy pace</p><p>Run, 5 minutes @ moderate pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>Run 5 minutes at easy pace and immediately continue to the 5 minutes easy pace of the 1st round of the main session.</p><p><b>Goal &amp; Pace</b></p><p>Run for a total duration of 60 minutes.
