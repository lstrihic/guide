Each rep is 1 Squat Snatch + 1 Overhead Squat. Improve technique and explosiveness. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and solid overhead squats. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between reps.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pull</strong></p><p>5×3 @ 85% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pulls from where you left the squat snatches + overhead squats. Work on pulling strength and technique (proper angles on the second pull). Focus on a slow, strong starting pull, once the barbel is over the knees increase your speed and finish with an explosive second pull to full range of motion. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>A.

The descending reps give you the psychological advantage, the 2nd part is considerably lighter than the first one so your performance should be faster or at least equal. In the 1st part break the hig-rep rounds (27, 21 reps) of both exercises into no more than 2-3 sets with minimum rest between and try to go the low-rep rounds unbroken. In the 3nd part go unbroken for as long as possible, if you need to break an exercise prefer to break the toes to bar and put effort on moving efficiently and unbroken on the thrusters.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>A. 52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p><b>Scaled</b></p><p>A.<b> </b>43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>B. 35/25kg – 75/55lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.
