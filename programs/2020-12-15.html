Focus on a powerful pull and a steady receiving position. Go with push jerks or split jerks yet make sure you push explosively and receive steadily. Warm up with an empty barbell and continue with sets of 2-3 reps until you reach 60%. Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 10 seconds between reps.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean pull</strong></p><p>2×3 @ 90% of Power clean</p><p>2×2 @ 100%</p><p>2×1 @ 105%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Move straight to pulls after the power clean &amp; jerks and work at the given percentages.

Break the wall-ball shots into a big and some smaller sets with short to minimum rest between and go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible (if you break immediately start again). Take a breath before you get on the rings. Go for a big first set and then continue with some smaller ones. Always stop 1-2 reps before failure and make sure you push yourself to your limits as you reach the finish.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*This would be a good test to hit our first ring muscle-up for those haven’t done this yet. But if you want to build your chest to bar technique under fatigue then prefer to go with chest to bar pull-ups instead of muscle-ups.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Ideally go the sit-ups unbroken, alternatively break them into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Consider that all the power snatches are considerably heavy so prefer to go with single lifts. Try to maintain a steady tempo throughout with equal rest between lifts. As weights gets heavier make sure you rest enough and ensure successfully made lifts, the more consistent you are with your resting time between lifts the better you will perform.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>GHD sit-ups <b>→</b> toes to rings <b>→</b> burpees</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>5 sets of</p><p>Run, 1200m @ increasing pace</p><p>Rest 3 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run 1200 meters at an easy pace as warm-up. In the main session try to achieve increased performance throughout. Start the first set at 4:45-5:25/km and progressively increase your pace with each set. Avoid big pace increases, since the pace of each next set should be faster yet steady. Jog 5 minutes as cool down.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>1200 → 800 meters @ given paces</p>
