Start the low-rep rounds by going both exercises unbroken and as reps increase go unbroken for as long as possible, break 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching exhaustion. Try to breath well throughout, especially on the thrusters. You want to avoid dropping the barbell on the thrusters so prefer to briefly rest, if needed, at the top position with the barbell overhead. Maintain a steadier tempo on the heavy load and a faster tempo at the lighter loads.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>1st set: 52/37kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>2nd set: 43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p>3rd set: 37/25kg – 80/55lb.</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Maintain a steady tempo on the Assault bike,<b> </b>65+ for men / 59+ for women that will allow you to prime for the ring muscle ups. On the ring muscle ups go with a first set of more than 50% of your Max-rep set when fresh and continue with sets of 3-5 reps until you complete the total reps. Consider that the volume is significantly big so make sure you don’t force a max effort attempt too soon, push harder only once you have reached near the finish. The more technical you are, the more comfortably and efficiently you will move on the rings.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> bike-erg or row</p><p>30 <b>→</b> 20* <b>→</b> 10** reps of</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to rings pull-ups</p><p>*Go with 20 reps if your Max set is 4-8 reps</p><p>**Go with 10 reps if your Max set is less than 4 reps</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Barbell Cycling – Power Clusters</strong></p><p>10 reps @ 65% of Max Power Clean</p><p>8 reps @ 70%</p><p>6 reps @ 75%</p><p>4 reps @ 80%</p><p>2 reps @ 85%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Start with touch &amp; go sets and if you find that you can’t sustain proper t&amp;g technique switch to single lifts. The goal is to move efficiently with the barbell, focus on a powerful push press after the clean and good drive and rebounding of the barbell on the ground in the touch &amp; go sets, make sure you take minimum rest between lifts if/when you go with singles. Consider this session slightly as a For time workout, work on the weight increases and make sure you load the bar fast and effectively, use the time to rest but don’t overdo it, take just as much rest as needed.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.
