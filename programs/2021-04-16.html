Work on the hang position and technique. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell, solid deep squat and overhead positions. Try to spend minimum time at the hang position, adding the less possible pressure to your back and grips. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pull from blocks</strong></p><p>1×3 @ 95% of Max Hang Squat Snatch</p><p>1×3 @ 100%</p><p>2×3 @ 105%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pulls from where you left the hang squat snatches.

Go with single lifts, rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>75/50 calories, Assault bike</p><p>50 double dumbbell shoulders to overhead 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>25 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>75 wall-balls 9/6kg – 20/14lb</p><p>50 double dumbbell power cleans 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>25 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>Cap: 18 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Move steadily through the total volume with smooth transitions between exercises.
