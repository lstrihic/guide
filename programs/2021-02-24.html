The key is the transitions. Ideally, go each exercise unbroken and make sure you keep your transitions between exercises fast and equal throughout the workout. Alternatively break the deadlifts into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. Move fast and steadily through the biggest part of the workout and, if possible, push harder as you reach the end by going unbroken and shortening the transitions even more. Same applies for the second part.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 124/82kg – 275/180lb <b>→</b> 102/70kg – 225/155lb</p><p>B. 61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg <b>–</b> 115/80lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A.
