Improve pulling power and comfort at the hang position. The hang starting position is with the barbell 10cm over the knees. Focus on a powerful pull and a solid reception.

Start the high-rep rounds (33, 27, 21) by breaking into a big set and 2-3 smaller manageable sets with short rest between (all touch &amp; go). As reps of each round decrease (15, 9) push harder and attempt to go unbroken for as long as possible. On the box jumps prefer to maintain a fast, sustainable pace from start to finish.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.
