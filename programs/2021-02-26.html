Improve technique and explosiveness. Focus on a technical pull, a fast drive under the bar and a solid deep receiving position. Build your confidence on the heavy single lifts. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pull</strong></p><p>3×2 @ 90% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pulls from where you left the squat snatches. Work on pulling strength. Focus on a slow, strong starting pull and an explosive finish. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>24 single arm dumbbell thrusters 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>24 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>Into</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>12 single arm devils press 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>12 bar muscle-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This workout consists of 2 consecutive couplets. The load of the dumbbell exercises will be lighter than you are used to since both are single dumbbell exercises, that will allow you to move faster. Go the thrusters with 12 reps with the right arm and 12 reps with the left arm, the devilis presses are alternating, switch arms as you leave the dumbbell on the ground. Move steadily through each couplet with focus on smooth and short transitions between exercises. Ideally go the gymnastic exercises unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p>Bar muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 3 sets of</p><p>8 double kettlebell snatches 20/12kg – 44/26lb</p><p>10 double kettlebell shoulders to overhead</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell Zottman curls 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p>16 dumbbell tricep kick backs (8 each arm)</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 20/12kg – 44/26lb → 16/8kg – 35/18lb</p><p>B. 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb → 7,5/2,5kg – 15/5lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>40 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>40 double dumbbell step-overs 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb, 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>40 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>40 meters, Double dumbbell front rack lunges 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and quality of movements. Break the handstand walk and front lack lunges into 10-meter unbroken distances. On the handstand walk move fast through each distance with quick steps and proper handstand form (toes pointing high, arms lockout, hollow position), take short yet adequate rest between distances to achieve that. Break the step-ups into big, manageable sets with short rest between. The front rack lunges is where you should show consistency, achieve a solid front rack position and move steadily and unbroken through each distance.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>40 <b>→</b> 30 <b>→</b> 20 meters* of</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> 4 wall-walks</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25kg</p><p>*Go with 40 meters if you can go 10 unbroken meters while fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.

The goal in the main session is to efficiently increase your strokes and pace with each part. In the B1 part keep steady 20 strokes and try to achieve a 2km PR pace +18 seconds, in the B2 part 22 strokes and 2km PR pace +16 seconds and in the B3 part 24 strokes and 2km PR pace + 10 seconds. Cool down by rowing 4 minutes at very light pressure.</p>
