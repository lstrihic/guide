Ideally go both exercises unbroken (touch &amp; go snatches), alternatively break an exercise into a big and a smaller set. Transitions make the difference, push steadily through the biggest part of the workout moving fast and equally between exercises and rounds. As you reach the end push harder to go unbroken and shorten your transitions to go for the strong finish. If you break make sure you move from exercise to exercise even faster.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

Make sure you put maximum effort in each portion. This doesn’t mean you should not be technical. The more technically you perform the exercises the more you will continue moving efficiently on the rings and the fresher you will be for each next attempt. Proper swings and kipping dips is a must.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to rings pull-ups</p><p>*Choose the option if you can’t perform at least 5 unbroken reps while fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>2 sets of</p><p>AMRAP 20 Minutes of</p><p>19 calories, Row</p><p>19 burpees to target</p><p>Rest 5 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to achieve high performance in each set.
