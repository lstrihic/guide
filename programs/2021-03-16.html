Go the bar facing burpees at a fast yet steady pace throughout the workout. Ideally go the lightweight snatches unbroken with touch &amp; go technique, alternatively break into a big and a smaller touch and go set. On the under heavy snatches, if you are comfortable with barbells, start with a touch and go set and if you break switch to singles, if not prefer to go with single lifts from the start. On the heavy lifts prefer to go with solid singles at a steady tempo. Move fast from the barbell to the burpees, take a breath before the lifts.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb → 52/37kg – 155/80lb</p><p>82/55kg – 180/120lb → 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>4 sets of</p><p>AMRAP 4 Minutes of</p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>15/12 calories, Assault bike</p><p>Max reps, Ring muscle-ups</p><p>Rest 1 minute between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Although your performance will drop with each set, try to put high effort in all sets of the session.
