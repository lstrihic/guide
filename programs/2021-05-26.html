In each portion, ideally, go the thrusters unbroken for as long as proper form allows, if you feel that you struggle break, take a breath and continue with smaller sets. Alternatively, break from the start into a big and no more than 1-2 smaller sets with short rest between. Go the gymnastics unbroken, if not possible, break into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Try to move as much as you can with the barbell on the thrusters, if you need to rest do it with the barbell overhead.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Bar muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A.
