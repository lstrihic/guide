Each rep is 1 Power Clean + 1 Push Press. Improve power and stability. Focus on a powerful pull, a proper reception on the front rack and and a strong push press with whole body utilization (use your legs to create momentum and then assist with your shoulders). Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between reps.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>4×3 @ 87% of Max Power Clean</p><p>2×3 @ 60%</p><p>2×2 @ 70%</p><p>2×1 @ 80%</p><p>2×1 @ 85%</p><p>3×1 @ 90%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pulls from where you left the power clean &amp; push press. Work on pulling strength and technique (proper angles on the second pull). Focus on a slow, strong starting pull, once the barbel is over the knees increase your speed and finish with an explosive shoulder shrug. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>A.

The goal is to perform well in both parts. Move fast and constantly through the 1st part, if possible increase your pace as you reach the end. Ideally go each exercise unbroken with fast equal transitions between. Alternatively, break the bar muscle-ups and/or hang power snatches into a big and a smaller set but make sure you perform even faster transitions that will allow you to be competitive timewise. The faster you finish the more time you have to rest before the lifts. You will need about 2-3 minutes to partly recover and catch your breath. Having reached 80% of your max hang power snatch during warm-up, start from that load and progressively increase weight until you reach your heaviest attempt. You will most probably have time for 3 or maybe 4 attempts so make every lift count.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Bar muscle-ups → chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p>52/37kg – 115/75lb <b>→</b> 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell burpee squat clean thrusters 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>20 meters, Double dumbbell overhead carry</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell hang clean pull 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>30 seconds, Prone Y raise hold</p><p>10 barbell curls 20/10kg – 45/25lb</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A.<b> </b>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb → 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>B. 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb → 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p>Barbell → crush grip dumbbell</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Push Press</strong></p><p>1×2 @ 70%</p><p>1×2 @ 75%</p><p>1×2 @ 80%</p><p>1×1 @ 85%</p><p>1×1 @ 90%</p><p>3×1 @ 95%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up with an empty barbell and progressively increase weight with sets of 3-4 reps until you reach 70%.

In the main session, perform 3 times a 12-minute running portion with 4 minute rest between. Try to achieve high performance in each portion. In each 12-minute select a pace within the given time window that you are able to sustain throughout the portion and increase with each next portion. Select wisely since each next portion should be considerably faster than the previous one. Cool down with a 5 minute jog.</p><p><strong>Options</strong><br>12 → 10 → 8 Minutes @ given paces</p>
