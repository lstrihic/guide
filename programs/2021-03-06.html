Ideally go each exercise unbroken and perform smooth transitions between in order to achieve that. Alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. The single arm dumbbell snatches are alternating, perform smooth and technical transitions mid-air for extra speed.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Strict <b>→</b> kipping handstand push-ups</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>*Choose kipping if you can’t go 8 unbroken strict reps while fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Push explosively through the calories on the ski and go straight to the rope climbs. On the rope move quickly and as technically as possible, use your legs to create momentum (kicks or kipping) and try to spend the least time on the rope, descend smoothly by sliding down, extending and jumping to the ground. The clean &amp; jerks are the most difficult part, consider that you should be fast but ensure successfully made lifts.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Leg-less <b>→</b> regular rope climbs</p><p>102/70kg 225/155lb <b>→</b> 82/52kg – 180/115lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.
