You should run fast because the distance is not long and running time will make a difference, yet make sure that your pace will not dramatically affect your performance on the rope and the kettlebells. Move fast and technically on the rope, find solid footings and squat to assist your arms, descend smoothly by sliding down (rope between feet) and jumping on the ground. Ideally go the kettlebell exercises unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. Perform fast transitions and try to regulate your breathing when running.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb —&gt; 20/12kg – 45/26lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Ideally go each round unbroken for as long as proper form allows, when you feel you struggle, take a breath and continue. Alternatively break from the start into manageable sets that will allow you to lift efficiently. Take short yet adequate rest between rounds (+- 60 seconds).</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Max Effort – Regionals 14.7</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>64 pull-ups</p><p>8 overhead squats 93/61kg – 205/135lb</p><p>Cap: 6 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Move explosively from the start, there is no time to waste. Go the pull-ups unbroken for as long as you can, break only 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching failure, take minimum rest and continue. The real challenge is the overhead squats, take a breath before you start your lifts. Ideally a heavy athlete could go for a snatch and continue with a solid touch and go set of overhead squats. Yet we recommend that you clean the barbell, place it on the back rack, jerk it to a solid overhead position and continue with the overhead squats. Don’t hesitate to push your limits, this is what training is all about.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>93/61kg – 205/135lb —&gt; 83/54kg – 185/120lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>A. 10 minutes @ 4’30”-5’30”/km</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rest 5 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 10 minutes @ 4’15”-5’20”/km</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rest 5 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C. 10 minutes @ 4’00”-5’10”/km</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up running for 10 minutes prior to the session and cool down for 5 minutes after the session at a comfortable pace of your choice.
