Improve stability and confidence. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position. The lightweight high-rep set allows you to work on proper angles and quality. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 12 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>60 calories, Row</p><p>50 wall-ball shots 9/6kg – 20/14lb.</p><p>40 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>30 strict handstand push-ups</p><p>20 front squats* 83/55kg – 180/120lb.</p><p>Cap: 17 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to move steadily through the total volume. Row at a fast yet sustainable pace that will allow you continue fresh to the next exercises. Ideally go the wall-ball shots and the chest to bar pull-ups unbroken, alternatively break into no more than 3-4 sets with short rest between. The strict handstand push-ups are a bit tricky, if you feel confident enough go with a big set and then some smaller manageable sets, if not break from the start into small sets that will allow you to push efficiently through the 30 reps. On the last exercise, the front squats, go unbroken for as long as possible, stop 1-2 reps before you feel like really reaching muscle failure. *Clean the bar from the ground.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>70/47kg – 155/105lb.</p><p>Pull-ups</p><p>Kipping handstand push-ups</p><p><b>Scale</b></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>Pull-ups <b>→</b> jumping pull-ups</p><p>Hand release push-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>20 touch &amp; go box jump overs</p><p>20 meters, Single-arm heavy dumbbell overhead carry 30/20kg – 65/45lb</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4 sets of</p><p>12 dumbbell man makers 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>8 double dumbbell bicep curls</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>30/20kg – 65/45lb <b>→</b> 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>15/10kg – 35/22,5lb → 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>40/30 calories, Assault bike</p><p>20 double dumbbell step overs 30/20kg – 65/45lb</p><p>10 devils press 30/20kg – 65/45lb.</p><p>20/15 calories, Assault bike</p><p>10 double dumbbell step overs 30/20kg – 65/45lb</p><p>5 devils press 30/20kg – 65/45lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This sessions is based on two same movement formats with the second having half the volume of the first. Go the starting triplet more steadily and push the finishing triplet hard. Go the 40/30 calories on the bike at a fast yet manageable pace, 65+/57+RPM, prefer to break the step overs into a big and a smaller set with short rest between and go the devils presses at the fastest manageable pace possible. Once the volume decreases start pushing really hard. Complete the 20/15 cals fast and explosively and go the dumbbell exercises unbroken for as long as possible, break only 1-2 reps before muscle failure.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> bike-erg <b>→</b> row</p><p>30/20kg – 65/45lb <b>→</b> 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.

In the main session you have to complete a total distance of 5000 meters. Focus on proper rowing technique and a steady stroke rate. The primary focus is to keep your strokes slow and powerful and then secondary focus to achieve the 2km PR pace + 15&nbsp;seconds. Cool down by rowing 2 minutes at a very light pressure.</p>
