The goal is to push steadily through both portions with a smooth and efficient transition from strict form to kipping technique. In the first portion focus on proper form and full range of motion. Perform fast reps, the less you stay on the handstand position the less you tax your upper body. Start by going unbroken and break into manageable sets as reps of each round become too many to handle. In the second portion focus on proper kipping technique, balance and whole-body movement. Move consistently for as long as possible at a fast yet steady tempo.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A.
