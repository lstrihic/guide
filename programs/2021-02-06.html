Go the hang clean &amp; jerks at a fast, steady tempo that will allow you to move efficiently. Go the double-unders fast and unbroken. Ideally go the chest to bar pull-ups and the front squats unbroken, alternatively break each exercise into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. If you have a good touch &amp; go technique on the shoulders go the shoulders to overhead unbroken, if not make a plan to break into no more than 2-3 sets with short to minimum rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p>52/37kg – 115/75lb <b>→</b> 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell crush grip bench presses 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>12 double dumbbell incline bench prone rows</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4 sets of</p><p>12 dumbbell crush grip tricep extensions 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb</p><p>10 double dumbbell reverse flys</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb → 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deadlifts</strong></p><p>5×2 @ 85%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up with sets of 3-4 reps &lt; 60% and 2-3 reps &lt; 85%.

Break the ring dips into no more than 2-3 set with minimum rest between. On the leg-less rope climbs move fast with proper and coordinated leg movement (kicks or kipping) and descent smoothly by sliding down and jumping. In the second couplet you will be under fatigue so make sure you break the bench presses into manageable sets but with minimum rest between. Most important be extra technical on the regular rope climbs, find solid footings and squat on the box in order to assist your upper body. The more technically you work on the rope the more efficiently you will push through the session.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring dips <b>→</b> ring push-ups</p><p>Leg-less <b>→</b> regular rope climbs</p><p>75/45kg – 165/100lb <b>→ </b>55/35kg – 120/80lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace <br>1000 meters @ 4:30-5:15/km<br>1000 meters @ easy pace<br>1000 meters @ 4:15-4:45/km<br>1000 meters @ easy pace<br>1000 meters @ 4:00-4:30/km<br>1000 meters @ easy pace<br>1000 meters @ 3:45-4:15/km<br>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run the first 1000 meters of the session as warm-up. Alternate between fast pace and easy pace through a total volume of 9000 meters, select paces within the given time frames that will allow you to sustain them through each 1000-meter distance and increase throughout the workout. Each next “fast pace” portion should be considerably faster than the previous one.<br>*Note as a score only the fast pace portions</p><p><strong>Options</strong><br>1000 → 800 meters @ given pace</p>
