Break the handstand walk into 10 or 5 meter distances. Try to go each distance (choose depending on your level and available training space) fast with short quick steps and proper body position. On the pull-ups ideally go unbroken for as long as possible breaking 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching muscle failure. Alternatively break from the start into a big and 2-3 smaller sets with short to minimum rest between. The more technical you are on the pull-ups the more efficiently you will push through them and the handstand walk. Go fast from HSW to pull-ups, smoother from pull-ups to HSW.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand walk —&gt; 8.6.4.2 reps of Wall-walks</p><p>*Go with wall-walks if you can’t go at least 5 unbroken meters of handstand walk when fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>5 sets of</p><p>AMRAP 6 Minutes of</p><p>Assault bike, 30/23 calories</p><p>20 burpee box-jumps over 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>Max calories, Assault bike</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Spend 6 minutes, 4 minutes at an easy pace – 2 minutes at a progressively increased pace, on the assault bike as warm up. Try to achieve high performance in each set. Push thought the couplet fast and efficiently, work at 67+ RPM<b> </b>for men / 60+ for women on the assault bike, and move at a fast, steady pace on the burpee box-jump overs. Once you finish the couplet go straight to the max-cal set. Make sure you move at fast yet sustainable pace until the last second with focus on breathing well throughout. The more remaining time the steadier the pace, the less remaining time the faster the pace.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> row</p>
