Improve explosiveness and technique. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell and a solid, deep receiving position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>2 rounds of</p><p>50 toes to bar</p><p>50 hang power cleans 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>50 box-jumps 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>50 push presses 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Go the first round fast yet steadily at a pace that will allow you to push the second round even faster. In the first round break each exercise into a big and some smaller manageable sets with short rest between. In particular prioritise to break the exercises in this order: toes to bars -&gt; cleans-&gt; push presses, from the one that is the most efficient to be broken to the less efficient. In the second round, ideally, go each exercise unbroken for as long as possible, meaning stop 2-3 reps before you feel like reaching muscle failure and try to shorten your transitions to the minimum. You might need to go with small, manageable sets, then have in mind that the better you manage to keep your in-between rest short the better you will perform.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell bent-over rows 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb</p><p>20 ring push-ups</p><p>10 dumbbell glute bridges 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 5 sets of</p><p>12 banded leg extensions</p><p>8 banded hamstring curls</p><p>30 seconds, Wall squat hold</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>25/17,5kg – 55/40lb → 20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb → 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>EMOM 20 Minutes of</p><p>Odd: 1x Macho Man* @ 80/52,5kg – 175/115lb.</p><p>Even: 3-5 bar muscle-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to be consistent throughout the 20 minutes ideally finishing the exercises within 30 seconds in each minute. *Macho Man is a complex of 3 power cleans + 3 front squats + 3 jerks.
