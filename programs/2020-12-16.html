Go this distance back and forth to perform the overhead lunges and the handstand walk. Try to move as efficiently as possible with the dumbbell. Focus on movement mechanics and technique, make sure you keep your arm locked out on the lunges and move the dumbbell smoothly on the snatches. The less taxed you are after the dumbbells the better you will cope with the handstand. Break the handstand push-ups from the start into small, manageable sets of 5-8 reps, don’t hesitate to go with single reps if you struggle with doubles or more. On the handstand walk try to move fast and go for unbroken 10-meter distances. Every 2,5 meters is 1 rep.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>Handstand push-ups <b>→</b> push-ups hand release</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> 10 wall-walks</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>8 double kettlebell bent-over rows 24/16kg – 53/35lb</p><p>12 double kettlebell power cleans</p><p>Rest as needed between exercises</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>12 double dumbbell overhead presses</p><p>8 double dumbbell bicep curls</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C.
