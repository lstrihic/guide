Improve explosiveness and stability. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pulls</strong></p><p>5×2 @ 95% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch pulls from where you left the squat snatches. Work on pulling strength. Focus on a slow, strong starting pull and an explosive finish. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>30 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>75 wall-balls 9/6kg – 20/14lb.</p><p>12 ring muscle-ups</p><p>50 handstand push-ups</p><p>12 ring muscle-ups</p><p>75 wall-balls 9/6kg</p><p>30 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>Cap: 21 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>In this workout work at two tempo. Move at a fast yet manageable tempo until you complete the handstand push-ups, then start pushing harder to go for the strong finish. Go the handstand walk by 10 meter unbroken distances, move fast with quick step and proper hollow position. Break the first wall ball shots into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between. Ideally go the ring-muscle up unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set. Go the handstand push ups with no more than 2-3 big sets with short rest between. Once you are done with the handstand push ups start pushing harder and push each exercise unbroken for as long as possible if you break take minimum rest and continue.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>30 <b>→</b> 20 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>12 <b>→</b> 7 ring muscle-ups</p><p>50 <b>→</b> 35 handstand push-ups</p><p><b>Scaled</b></p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> single arm dumbbell overhead lunges 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>9/6kg – 20/14lb <b>→</b> 6/4kg – 14/10lb</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>Handstand push-ups <b>→</b> hand release push-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Push fast and explosively through the 20 calories on the assault bike. Prefer to break the step overs and power cleans of the first round into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between, go the same exercises in the second round unbroken for as long as possible. The strict handstand push-ups is the challenge, go the first round with a big and no more than 1-2 smaller sets with short rest between and push through the second round with small manageable sets with minimum rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike → bike-erg → row</p><p>30/20kg – 65/45lb → 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.&nbsp;Row 4 minutes @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A2.

Focus primarily on steady strokes and secondarily on pace. Cool down by rowing 4 minutes at a very light pressure.</p>
