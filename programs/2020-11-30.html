The starting position is with the barbell about 10cm above the knees. Focus on a powerful pull and a solid overhead position. Warm up with an empty barbell and continue with sets of 2-3 reps until you reach 65%. Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Squat snatch</strong></p><p>1×2 @ 65%</p><p>1×2 @ 70%</p><p>1×2 @ 75%</p><p>2×1 @ 80%</p><p>2×1 @ 85%</p><p>2×2 @ 90%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Work on explosiveness and confidence.

It’s a pull-push format with high volume on each movement. What you should do is maintain a steady pace on the row (1500cal/hr for men and 1200cal/hr for women) and break the handstand push-ups smartly (e.g. 15.10.8 – 12.9.6 – 12.9). The last 2 sets is where you give all you got, sprinting the row and attempting unbroken HSPUs.

Move fast on the triplet: Push efficiently on the Ski-erg and Assault bike, start explosively gaining the first calories and then maintain the momentum going as much as you can, go the burpees at a fast yet sustainable pace. Perform fast transitions between exercises and go straight to the Max-rep attempt. On the max-rep set move at a steady pace from first until the last second of the set, the more remaining time the steadier the pace the less remaining time the faster the pace.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ski-erg <b>→</b> row</p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> 80 double-unders</p>
