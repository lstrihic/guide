It is a total duration of 20 minutes. You have to perform well in both parts. Complete as many reps as you can of the triplet in 14 minutes. Move fast on the rower 1300+ for men / 1050+ for women and go the overhead squats and ring muscle-up unbroken. Perform smooth transitions that will allow you to do that. Warm up with a barbell before the workout reaching a load of about 80-85% of you 1rep max. Take about 2 minutes after the AMRAP to catch your breath, then go for 3 solid lifts starting from a load that was comfortably achieved during warm up.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Ideally go the GHD sit-ups unbroken for as long as possible. On the legless rope climbs ascend fast with proper and coordinated arm-leg movement and descend smoothly by sliding, extending your body and jumping on the ground. Break the overhead lunges into 10-meter unbroken distances, focus on a solid overhead position.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Legless rope climbs <b>→</b> regular rope climbs 4,7m</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A. 2400 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 10 rounds of</p><p>100 meters @ 85-95% of Max effort</p><p>300 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run 2400 meters (warm-up) and 1600 meters (cool down) at a comfortable pace of your choice. Perform 30-meter distances of front swings, side cross swings, front leg raises, toe taps… etc and finish with 3 sets of 50 meter sprints. Start from 85% of Max effort (100 meters) and increase to a pace near 93% of Max effort. Do not push each set to your limits, the aim is to focus on sprint mechanics and be consistent throughout.
