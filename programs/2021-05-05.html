The first portion has a decreasing volume of several exercises which inversely increase in the second portion. Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as you can, if you break continue immediately with the remaining reps. Ideally go the wall-ball shots unbroken, alternatively break into a big and no more than 1-2 smaller sets with short rest between. Do the same for the chest to bar pull-ups and go the devils presses at the fastest sustainable tempo in the first portion, at a steady sustainable tempo in the second portion.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups —&gt; pull-ups</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/25lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>12 wide stance sumo deadlifts 20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb.</p><p>10 wide stance dumbbell cleans</p><p>15 crush grip narrow squats</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>(switch arm in each set)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 rounds of</p><p>15 toes to bar</p><p>60 seconds, Elbow plank</p><p>15 high to low planks</p><p>60 seconds, Hollow hold</p><p>30 alternating single-leg jackknives</p><p>60 seconds, Arch hold</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Front Squat</strong></p><p>Daily Max</p><p>Then</p><p>1×10 @ 75%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up to a heavy lift for the day with sets of 4 reps &lt; 55%, 2-3 reps &lt; 80% and a few single reps &gt; 80%.
