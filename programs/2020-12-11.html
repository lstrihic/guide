This is a total volume of 15 minutes, perform single lifts throughout the whole session. The goal is solid, successfully made lifts and short, equal rest between them. The 4th, 9th and 14th minute is where you increase weight on the bar. Warm up with an empty bar and continue with sets of 2-3 reps until you reach 75%.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>2 rounds of</p><p>Row, 60/45 calories</p><p>40 single-arm dumbbell snatches 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>20 bar muscle-ups</p><p>Cap: 18 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Pace the 1st round, push the 2nd round harder by going for the unbroken and shortening your transitions between exercises.

In the first rounds break the muscle-ups into big, manageable sets with short rest between, in the second round go unbroken for as long as possible (break 1-2 reps before failure).</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>20 <b>→</b> 15 <b>→</b> 10 reps of</p><p>Bar muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest to bar pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 5 unbroken reps of bar muscle-ups while fresh</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

In the main session try to achieve high performance in each portion. Focus on primarily maintaining exactly the strokes prescribed and secondarily achieving the given time/meters pace. Working on strokes will help you efficiently control your pace and your cardio vs strength balance. Row 5 minutes at very low pressure as cool-down.</p>
