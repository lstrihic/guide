Improve power and stability. Focus on a strong pull, an explosive shoulder shrug and a solid jerk (work on split jerk technique). Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>21.15.9 reps of</p><p>Deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155lb</p><p>Box-jumps over 60/50cm</p><p>Then,</p><p>21.15.9 reps of</p><p>Deadlifts 143/90kg – 315/200lb</p><p>Box-jumps over 76/60cm</p><p>Cap: 11 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The descending reps give you the psychological advantage. Avoid pushing the first part of the workout too hard considering that the second part is the real challenge. Ideally go the deadlifts of the first part unbroken, alternatively break the rounds of 21, 15 reps into a big and a smaller set with short rest between and go the round of 9 reps unbroken. On the box jumps maintain a fast sustainable pace, ideally go with touch &amp; go technique. On the second part in which the difficulty increases, break all rounds of deadlifts into small manageable sets yet make sure you take minimum rest between lifts. Go the box-jump over at a manageable pace that will allow you to move efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>143/90kg – 315/200lb <b>→</b> 125/80kg – 275/175lb</p><p><b>Scaled</b></p><p>102/70kg – 225/155lb <b>→</b> 80/55kg – 175/120lb</p><p>143/90kg – 315/200lb <b>→</b> 102/70kg – 225/155lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A.
