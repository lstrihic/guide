Ideally, go the lightweight snatches unbroken and maintain a sustainable pace on the box-jumps. Prefer to use touch and go technique on both exercises. Alternatively, break the snatches into a big and no more than 2-3 manageable sets with short to minimum rest between. The heavyweight snatches are broken into rounds and this allows you to go each round unbroken. If this is not possible, start each round with solid single lifts and, if you feel confident enough, try to finish with a touch and go set.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb. —&gt; 52/37kg – 115/80lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Accessory Work</b></p><p>A. 10.8.6.4.2 reps of</p><p>Strict pull-ups</p><p>Max reps, Shoulder presses 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.
