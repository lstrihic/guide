You are given 15 minutes in which you have to complete 10 rounds of 3 power snatches + 35 double-unders and in the remaining time find a 1 Rep Max Squat Snatch. You have to perform your best in both parts. Ideally, go the couplet with unbroken snatches and double-unders, focus on the transitions, the better you manage to keep your rounds fast and equal the better you will perform. Alternatively, go with single lifts with minimum rest between them. On the squat snatch have in mind that you should get some rest before you start lifting so the faster you finish part 1 the better it is even from that perspective. The starting load will be decided during the warm up, the constant power snatching of part 1 may affect your squat snatch efficiency so we recommend that you start at 80-85% of your Pr, secure a lift and continue from then on as you feel.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 3 sets of</p><p>20 d-ball hug squats 70/45kg – 150/100lb</p><p>10 d-ball hug step-ups</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 unbroken double dumbbell hang squat cleans 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>20 meters, Double dumbbell lunges</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>70/45kg – 150/100lb → 45/30kg – 100/70lb</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb → 20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb → 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strongman</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>100 meters, Double kettlebell front rack carry 32/24kg – 70/52lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Break the total distance in 20 or 10 meter distances depending on the available space.
