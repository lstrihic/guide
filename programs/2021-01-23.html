Go with power jerks. Focus on an explosive push, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position (arms straight and locked out, head forward). Also work on smooth rebounding on the shoulders. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hang Power Clean + Hang Squat Clean</strong></p><p>2×3 @ 60%</p><p>1×3 @ 70%</p><p>1×2 @ 75%</p><p>1×2 @ 80%</p><p>5×1+2 @ 85%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up with an empty barbell and continue with sets of 2 hang power cleans + 2 hang squat cleans until you reach 60%.

Avoid going too hard in the first rounds, break into really manageable sets (ideally no more than 3-4 sets for presses, 2-3 sets for muscle ups) with short to minimum rest between and try to keep your upper body fresh and going. As you reach the finish push harder, specifically in the last round try to go each exercise unbroken for as long as possible. Break 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching failure. The more technical you are on the muscle-ups, the less you tax your body and the better you are able to push through the workout.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg – 115/75lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>6 rounds of</p><p>Run, 5 minutes @ easy pace</p><p>Run, 5 minutes @ moderate pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run for a total duration of 60 minutes. Alternate your pace every five minutes. The easy pace should be a comfortable, manageable pace that will allow you to breath well and partially recover. The moderate pace should make you feel uncomfortable but still allow you to move at a fast yet sustainable pace. Prefer to keep any pace variations to the minimum, select a pace for each zone and try to keep it steady. Finish with a 5 minutes walk.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>6 <b>→</b> 5 <b>→</b> 4 rounds</p>
