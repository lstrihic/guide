Ideally go the snatches touch &amp; go and unbroken, alternatively start with a big unbroken set and continue with fast single lifts if you find yourself losing form and efficiency. On the gymnastics, try to go unbroken with fast reps using butterfly technique for pull-ups and chest to bar pull-ups, and kipping technique for bar muscle-ups. In general, competition-wise, prefer to push the exercise you are good at, break and move comfortably on the exercise you struggle.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>15 —&gt; 12 —&gt; 9 reps of</p><p>Pull-ups</p><p>10 —&gt; 8 —&gt; 6 reps of</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>5 —&gt; 4 —&gt; 3 reps of</p><p>Bar muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Choose a number of reps that you can easily perform unbroken while fresh</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>5 single-arm kettlebell shoulder to overhead 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>5 single arm kettlebell snatch balances</p><p>5 single arm kettlebell overhead squats</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>*switch arms with each set</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 5 sets of</p><p>15 seconds, L-hang from pull-up bar</p><p>Rest 30 seconds</p><p>10 weighted, GHD sit-ups, 9/7kg – 20/14lb. med-ball</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 20/16kg – 44/35lb. —&gt; 16/12kg – 35/26lb.</p><p>9/7kg – 20/14lb. —&gt; 7/4kg – 14/10lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Front Squat</strong></p><p>1×3 @ 70%</p><p>1×2 @ 80%</p><p>1×1 @ 90%</p><p>1×3 @ 75%</p><p>1×2 @ 85%</p><p>1×1 @ 92%</p><p>1×3 @ 80%</p><p>1×2 @ 90%</p><p>1×1 @ 95%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Warm up</strong></p><p>3x 8 front squats @ 20/15kg barbell</p><p>Then,</p><p>Sets of 3 reps until 70%.</p><p><strong>Goal</strong></p><p>Improve form and consistency.

Be explosive on the rower, you should perform long and strong pulls that will keep your cardiorespiratory function low (1 pull —&gt; 1 calory is a good tempo), then go straight to an unbroken distance of 10 meters handstand walk. The hardest part of the workout is the transitions, the more consistently you move from one exercise to the other the better.
