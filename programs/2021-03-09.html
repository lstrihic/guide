Start steadily and increase your pace to max effort as you reach the finish. Ideally, go each exercise in each part unbroken with smooth transitions between them. Alternatively prefer to break the strict handstand push-ups into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. Mark a target 10cm above your extended arms overhead for the burpees (eg. pull-up bar) , go at a fast pace thaw will allow you to effortlessly touch the targer on every rep.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A.

Go the power cleans touch &amp; go for as long as you can and, if you need to break, continue without rest with single lifts. Start the squat cleans with single lifts and switch to touch &amp; go as you reach the finish, if you feel comfortable enough.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>2 rounds of</p><p>60 GHD sit-ups</p><p>45 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>30 single leg squats</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on form and quality of movements.
