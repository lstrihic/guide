Prefer to break the high-rep round of muscle ups into a big and 1-2 smaller sets with minimum rest between. Ideally, go the other rounds unbroken, if this is not possible break the round of 12 reps as well, yet make sure you perform even faster transitions between rounds and exercises. The goal is to go the overhead squats steadily and unbroken. If you are comfortable with barbells squat snatch, if not prefer to clean and then drive the barbell overhead either with a jerk, a back jerk or a snatch balance. Find a solid overhead position and go for controlled overhead squats.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>Ring muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest.

Make sure you primarily keep steady strokes and then achieve the prescribed time/distance pace. In the second portion strokes are free; find the optimal stroke rate for you considering that more strokes mean higher heart rate and less strokes mean more powerful pulls. Start with fewer strokes and increase progressively.</p><p><b>Cool down</b></p><p>800 meters @ easy pace</p>
