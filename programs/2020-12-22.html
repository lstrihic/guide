Prefer to break each exercise from the start into a big and a smaller set (5-4, 6-3) with fast, efficient reps. The tax is commutative and you don’t want to reach an early muscle failure in either exercise. Go the biggest part of the workout at 90-95% of max effort, then start pushing harder by shortening your transitions and trying more the unbroken on each exercise.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>102/70kg – 225/155lb —&gt; 80/55kg – 175/120lb.</p><p>Strict handstand push-ups —&gt; kipping handstand push-ups —&gt; hand release push-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Go each exercise unbroken on the first, manageable rounds and start breaking into a big and a smaller set as reps in each round get more than you can handle. Prefer to break the dips rather than the hang power snatches in order to catch your breath or briefly recover. Consider that it’s better to go the snatches unbroken for as long as possible in order to avoid any unnecessary movements (deadlifts etc).</p><p>*2 times each set</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring dips —&gt; ring push-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>8 sets of</p><p>Run, 800 meters @ increasing pace every 2 sets</p><p>Rest 3 minutes between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run 800 meters at an easy pace as warm up.
