Ideally, go all the chest to bar pull-ups unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between. The goal is to move efficiently on the overhead squats. Find that solid overhead position and go unbroken for as long as proper form allows. If you have to break an exercise prefer to break the chest to bar pull-ups and aim at unbroken overhead squats. Transitions will play a major role on your performance, go fast from the barbell to the pull-up bar, go smoothly from the pull-up bar to the barbell.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p>83/55kg – 180/120lb <b>→</b> 70/50kg – 155/70lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A.

Go the<b> </b>deficit handstand push-ups unbroken for as long as proper form allows, stop 2-3 reps before you feel like reaching muscle failure. If you are not comfortable with handstand prefer to break the first portion into manageable sets.

Complete the couplet of each AMRAP fast, push explosively through the Assault bike/Burpee box-jumps and then go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps. In the max-rep set maintain a fast, sustainable pace that will allow you to move efficiently for the the whole remaining time.</p><p><strong>Option</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> row</p>
