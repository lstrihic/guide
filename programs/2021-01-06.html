Each set at the given percentages is 1 snatch balance + 2 overhead squats. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell and a solid overhead position (shoulders tight and pushed upwards, back straight). Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets. The use of wristbands is recommended.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hang Squat Snatch</strong></p><p>2×2 @ 60%</p><p>2×2 @ 70%</p><p>2×2 @ 80%</p><p>4×1 @ 85%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up with an empty barbell and progressively increase weight with sets of 2-3<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>reps until you reach 60%.

In each portion reps of cleans decrease by one and weight on the barbell increases. There is a high volume of each exercise so make sure you pace and avoid pushing too hard leaving the tank without gas early. Ideally go the handstand push-ups unbroken, alternatively break into sets of 5-3 or 4-4 reps that will allow you to move efficiently through the total volume. The key is the cleans. You can perform them either power or squat. Prefer to start the lighter weights with power cleans and then switch to squat cleans in order to keep your tempo steady throughout the session. We recommend that you avoid touch &amp; go technique, it’s better to maintain a fast, steady tempo keeping minimum rest between lifts, from start to finish, rather than requiring longer rest at some point during the workout.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>4 cleans 50/37,7kg – 110/82lb</p><p>3 cleans 70/47,5/55kg – 155/105lb</p><p>2 cleans 90/55kg – 200/120lb</p><p>1 clean 110/60kg – 245/165130lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell cleans 25/17,5kg – 55/40lb</p><p>20 double dumbbell step-overs</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.
