Ideally go the strict handstand push ups of each round unbroken, alternatively break into a big and 1-2 smaller sets with short rest between. Practice the burpee step overs and try to move consistently at a steady tempo. On the rope climb move technically with proper leg assistance (solid footing and squatting on the rope) and descent smoothly by sliding down and jumping on the ground. Perform smooth transitions that will allow you to move efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Strict handstand push-ups —&gt; pike push-ups – elevated feed</p><p>32,5/22,5kg – 70/50lb —&gt; 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.

In the main session, focus on consistency, the goal is to row the given distances at exactly the stroke/minute and time/distance paces with priority on the strokes. Row 2 minutes at super light pressure as cool down.</p>
