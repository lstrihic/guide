The descending reps allow you to keep your effort level high, prefer to break the high-rep sets into a big and 1-2 smaller sets with minimum rest between and go the low-rep set unbroken for as long as possible. On the front squats push yourself to go each set unbroken for as long as possible as a steady tempo, the less you drop the bar the better.</p><p>Men: 43.52.61.70.82kg – 95.115.135.155.180lb</p><p>Women: 30.37.43.50.55kg – 65.80.95.110.120lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>16 double dumbbell deadlifts 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>8 double dumbbell bicep curls</p><p>12 double dumbbell push presses</p><p>Rest as needed between exercises</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 rounds of</p><p>15 sit-ups</p><p>30 arc rocks</p><p>45 hollow rocks</p><p>60 flutterkicks</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>15/10kg – 35/22,5lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Back Squat</strong></p><p>1×2 @ 50%</p><p>1×2 @ 60%</p><p>1×2 @ 65%</p><p>1×2 @ 70%</p><p>1×2 @ 75%</p><p>3×1 @ 80%</p><p>1×5 @ 65% fast</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up to 50% with sets of 2-3 reps.
