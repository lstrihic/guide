Each rep is 1 Squat Clean + 1 Front Squat + 1 Jerk. Improve technique and consistency. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and solid, technical jerks (work on split jerk technique). Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between reps.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 21 Minutes of</p><p>20 handstand push-ups</p><p>20 calories, Row</p><p>20 wall-ball shots 9/6kg – 20/14lb</p><p>20 single arm dumbbell snatches 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to move constantly and efficiently through the 21 minutes. Maintain a fast yet manageable pace for the biggest part of the workout, 15+ minutes, then, if possible increase your pace. Ideally go the handstand push-ups and the wall-ball shots unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between that will allow you to move efficiently. Go the single-arm dumbbell snatches at a fast steady pace. The reps are alternating, prefer to switch arms mid-air for speed. On the rower try to maintain a steady pace throughout the workout without extreme variations, 1350+ for men/1050+ for women. The key is to keep equal transitions between exercises and throughout the workout, the more you are able to keep them fast and equal the better your performance. As you reach the finish try to go unbroken for as long as possible, shorten your transitions and go for the strong finish.<b></b></p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand push-ups <b>→</b> push-ups hand release</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Go the GHD sit-ups unbroken for as long as proper form allows, a good way to go is with a big set and no more than 2-3 smaller sets with short rest between On the lighter snatches break into big yet manageable touch &amp; go sets, if you realise that your touch &amp; go form is starting to fail switch to single lifts with minimum rest between. On the heavier snatches if you are not comfortable with the load don’t hesitate to switch early or even start with solid single lifts.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>GHD <b>→</b> toes to rings</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p>83/55kg – 180/120lb <b>→</b> 70/50kg – 155/70lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.
