Improve technique and explosiveness. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the bar and a solid deep receiving position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>50 GHD sit-ups</p><p>40 wall-ball shot 9/6kg – 20/14lb</p><p>30 power cleans 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>20 ring muscle-ups</p><p>30 power cleans 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>40 wall-balls shots 9/6kg – 20/14lb</p><p>50 GHD sit-ups</p><p>Cap: 20 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This workout has a decreasing volume of GHD sit-ups, wall-balls and power cleans which increases once again after the muscle-ups, so keep that in mind and pace until you finish the muscle-ups, then push harder to a near max effort pace. Ideally go the first GHD sit-ups and wall-ball shots unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between. On the power cleans prefer to go with single lifts at a steady, fast tempo on both before and after-muscleup lifts. Go the muscle-ups ideally with a big and a smaller set with short rest between, alternatively break into manageable sets (about 5-7 reps) that will allow you to move efficiently. Go the last GHD sit-ups and wall-ball shots unbroken for as long as possible, break only 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching failure.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>GHD sit-ups <b>→</b> weighted sit-ups 15/10kg dumbbell to chest</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg – 155/80lb</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to rings pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Go the toes to bar unbroken for as long as possible, break 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching failure. On the rower try to maintain a pace 1400+ for men / 1150+ for women. The sandbag cleans is the most difficult part, you will be already gasping for air and you have to establish a steady, fast tempo. Perform fast transitions between exercises and make sure you take minimum rest between sandbag cleans.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Sand-bag cleans <b>→</b> barbell power cleans 82/55kg – 180/120lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.
