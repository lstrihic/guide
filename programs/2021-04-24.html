The lifts at 65% are 1 time of 2 squat cleans + 1 jerk, at 80% are 2 times of 1 squat clean + 1 jerk. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell, a solid deep squat position, and technical jerks. Prefer to go with split jerks and work on explosiveness and technique. Go with single reps of squat cleans, rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>2×3 @ 95% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>2×3 @ 100%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pulls from where you left the squat clean &amp; jerks. Improve starting pull strength and focus on proper lifting angles. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>30 double-unders</p><p>10 toes to bar</p><p>3 overhead squats 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>30 double-unders</p><p>10 toes to bar</p><p>6 overhead squats 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>30 double-unders</p><p>10 toes to bar</p><p>9 overhead squats 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>30 double-unders</p><p>10 toes to bar</p><p>12 overhead squats 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>30 double-unders</p><p>10 toes to bar</p><p>15 overhead squats 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>Cap: 15 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to be consistent on the overhead squats throughout the session. You have to be able to push efficiently and unbroken throughout the total volume under metabolic fatigue developed by the double-unders and the toes to bar. Go each exercise unbroken, perform fast transitions between exercises yet take a breath before overhead squats to ensure unbroken sets with focus on a solid overhead position.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Alternate between 5-rep sets at a standard 70% percentage and singles or double at increasing percentages. Focus on steady tempo at the high-rep sets and solid lifts at the increasing reps.

If your are comfortable with ring muscle-ups go for an unbroken set, if not break into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between, then go straight to the bar-facing burpees over with focus on breathing well. Before you start lifting catch a breath and go for 5 solid single reps at the fastest possible tempo which can ensure successfully made lifts. Don’t hesitate to reach your limits on the snatch and risk a failed attempt, after all this is what training is all about!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> 20 toes to rings</p><p>83/57kg – 185/125lb <b>→</b> 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>A. 2000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 1000 meters @ 5’00”-5’40”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’30”-5’20”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’00”-5’00”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>1000 meters @ 3’30”-4’40”/km</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This is a total distance of 9000 meters.
