Move at two tempos, maintain a steady pace until you complete the 75 wall-balls and then start pushing harder to go for the strong finish. Ideally go the wall-balls unbroken for as long as you can, if you break take minimum rest and continue. Alternatively, break into a big and a smaller set. Break the handstand walk into 10-meter unbroken distances and go the double-unders unbroken for as long as you can, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps. On the rope climb move fast by finding solid footing and squatting on the rope to assist your upper body, descend smoothly by sliding down and jumping on the ground.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand Walk —&gt; 6 wall walks</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Go the GHD sit-ups unbroken for as long as you can. Ideally, go the kettlebell exercises unbroken as well, alternatively break the swings in each round into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. If you are comfortable with strict handstand push-ups attempt to complete each round unbroken and then break into more manageable sets, if not, prefer to break each round from the start into a big and smaller set. Perform smooth transitions that will allow you move efficiently throughout.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 20/12kg – 44/26lb.</p><p>Strict hspu —&gt; pike push-ups (elevated feet)</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.

In the main session perform 7 sets with 90 seconds rest between, follow the given pace and a free stroke rate to achieve that pace. Keep in mind that more strokes mean higher cardiovascular tax, fewer strokes mean need of powerful strokes. Row 800 meters at very light pressure as cool down.</p>
