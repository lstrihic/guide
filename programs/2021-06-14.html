The volume of each exercise is demanding. Ideally go each exercise unbroken with fast transitions, if you feel the need to break prefer to swiftly break the chest to bar pull-ups as it is easier and less time consuming to reposition. Alternatively, plan your breaks, if you are good at gymnastics push the chest to bar pull-ups for unbroken, if you are strong with the barbell, push the thrusters for unbroken, in both cases break the other exercise into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>52/37kg – 115/80lb. —&gt; 43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>6 bent over barbell rows, As heavy as proper form allows</p><p>12 bicep curls to overhead press 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4.8.12.16.</p><p>Box jump over box (no touch)</p><p>Double dumbbell devils presses 22,5/15</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C. 5 sets of</p><p>30 seconds, Hollow hold</p><p>30 seconds, Alternating heel touches</p><p>30 seconds, Right side plank hold</p><p>30 seconds, Left side plank hold</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb. —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>C. 5 sets —&gt; 3 sets of</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Back Squat</strong></p><p>1×5 @ 70%</p><p>2×3 @ 75%</p><p>1×3 @ 80%</p><p>1×3 @ 85%</p><p>2×3 @ 90%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up with sets of 4-5 reps until you reach 70%.

Go each exercise unbroken, try to maintain a steady tempo throughout the session with smooth transitions between them. Use a belt and a kettlebell on the pull-ups. Select a kettlebell that will be heavy but still allow you to complete each round of pull-ups unbroken.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Strict full deficit handstand push-ups —&gt; strict regular handstand push-ups</p><p>Strict weighted pull-ups —&gt; strict bodyweight chest to bar pul-ups</p><p>—</p><p></p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>Bike-erg, 4km</p><p>Ski-erg, 2km</p><p>Row, 2km</p><p>Bike-erg, 2km</p><p>Ski-erg, 1km</p><p>Row, 1km</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>There are two sequences of the same ergs yet the volume of the second one is half that of the first. Pace the first part at 75-80% of max effort and push the second and smaller one harder, 85-90% of max effort. Try to breathe well throughout the session, perform smooth transitions and focus on movement technique and mechanics, the more technical you are the better you will breathe and the smoother you will push through the total volume.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Bike-erg —&gt; air-bike</p><p>Ski-erg —&gt; run</p>
