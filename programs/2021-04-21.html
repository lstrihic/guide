The strategy is to pace the first set of gymnastics, move steadily on the snatches and push the last set of gymnastics hard. So if you are comfortable with chest to bar pull-ups/bar muscle ups go the first set unbroken, then continue with single lifts of snatches at a fast steady tempo and finish each portion by going the last set of chest to bar pull-ups/bar muscle ups unbroken for as long as you can. If you are not comfortable, prefer to break the first set of gymnastics break into a big and 1-2 smaller sets with short to minimum rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p>*Go with pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 15 unbroken chest to bar pull-ups while fresh</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p>Bar muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 8 unbroken reps of muscle-ups while fresh</p><p>83/57kg – 185/125lb <b>→</b> 70/47kg – 155/105lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>15 double dumbbell step-overs 15/10kg – 35/20lb, 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>10 double dumbbell push presses</p><p>8 double dumbbell incline bench rows</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 set of</p><p>15 GHD sit-ups</p><p>20 arch rocks on the floor</p><p>Max time, Weighted GHD hollow hold 10/5kg – 25/15lb</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>15/10kg – 35/20lb → 10/5kg – 20/10lb</p><p>Weighted GHD hollow → bodyweight GHD hollow → hollow hold on the floor</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Front Squat</strong></p><p>2×2 @ 80%</p><p>3×1 @ 85%</p><p>3×1 @ 90%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up with sets of 2-3 reps until you reach 80%.

Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break take minimum rest and immediately continue with the remaining reps. Ideally go the deficit handstand push-ups, reps decrease-height increases in each portion, unbroken for as long as you can breaking 2-3 reps before you feel like reaching muscle failure, alternatively, break from the start into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Lastly, break the handstand walk into 10-meter unbroken distances move fast with quick long steps. *Kick hard with your legs to assist your upper body.
