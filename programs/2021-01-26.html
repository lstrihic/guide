The lifts at 60% are 2 sets of 2 squat cleans + 2 jerks, at 80% are 2 sets of 1 squat clean + 1 jerk. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell, a solid deep receiving position and a powerful jerk. On the jerk push explosively and aim at a solid receiving position.

It’s all about pace and consistency. Ideally go the handstand push-ups unbroken and then maintain tha fastest sustainable pace possible on the box-jumps (ideally touch &amp; go), dumbbell snatches (mid-air arm switches) and air-squats. The only exercise that you might need to break is the HSPUs, if you are not comfortable with gymnastic exercises prefer to break them up from the start into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Go with smooth transitions for the biggest part, then move faster.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand push-ups <b>→</b> push-ups hand release</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

The goal is to move efficiently with the barbell, focus on proper technique and good rebounding on the ground in the touch &amp; go sets, make sure you take minimum rest between lifts when you go with singles, especially as the weight get heavier avoid resting too much between lifts. Consider this session slightly as a For time workout, work on weight increases make sure you load the bar with the fastest possible way, use the time to rest but don’t overdo it, take as much rest as needed.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>80/50kg – 175/110lb.</p><p>85/52,5kg – 187/115lb</p><p>90/55kg – 200/120lb.</p><p>95/57,5kg – 210/125lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>10 rounds of</p><p>12 GHD sit-ups</p><p>10 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>1 leg-less rope climb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and quality of movements.

On the handstand walk go for 10-meter or 2×5-meter unbroken distances depending on your level, in any case try to move fast with quick step and a solid handstand (straight body) position. On the legless rope climbs ascent fast with coordinated upper-lower body motion (leg kicks) and descent smoothly by gliding down.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>GHD sit-ups <b>→</b> toes to rings</p><p>10 <b>→</b> 7,5 <b>→</b> 5 meters of</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> 2 wall-walks</p><p>*Choose a distance that you can easily perform unbroken when fresh</p><p>Leg-less <b>→</b> regular rope climb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.
