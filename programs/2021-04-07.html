On the single arm dumbbell overhead lunges move steadily with focus on proper reps and a solid overhead position (elbow lockout, shoulders tight), switch arm every 7,5 meters. The single arm dumbbell hang clean and presses are alternating, go with mid-air transitions and make sure you do the presses properly without leg/hip assistance. Ideally go the handstand push-ups unbroken for as long as you can breaking 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching failure and then continue with smaller manageable sets with minimum rest between. Alternatively break from the start into manageable sets that will allow you to push efficiently through the 60 reps.</p><p>*2,5 meters = 1 rep</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p>Handstand walk <b>→</b> 6 wall-walks</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 12.10.8.6.4</p><p>Wide push-ups</p><p>Double kettlebell high pulls 16/12kg – 35/26lb</p><p>Barbell overhead tricep extensions 20/10kg – 45/25lb</p><p>Kettlebell single leg squats </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 rounds of</p><p>30 crunches</p><p>60 seconds, Hollow hold</p><p>20 leg raises</p><p>40 seconds, Reverse plank hold</p><p>30 arch rocks</p><p>60 seconds, Arch hold</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Wide push-up → knee wide push-up</p><p>16/12kg – 35/26lb → 12/8kg – 26/18lb</p><p>20/10kg – 45/25lb → 15kg/PVC – 35lb/PVC</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Front Squat</strong></p><p>2×3 @ 70%</p><p>2×2 @ 80%</p><p>1×1 @ 90%</p><p>1×1 @ 95%</p><p>1×2 @ 80%</p><p>1×3 @ 70%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up with sets of 2-3 reps until you reach 70%.

On the ring push ups prefer to break from the start into manageable sets that will allow you to move efficiently through the total volume, only attempt to go unbroken, if possible, at the low-rep sets. Go the double-unders fast and unbroken. Perform fast transitions from push-ups to double-unders, smooth transitions from double-unders to push-ups. On the regular rope climbs focus on being extra technical and always finding solid footings to squat on the rope and assist your ascents. *Work with the extra load and adapt to discomfort of the vest.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Leg-less <b>→</b> regular rope climbs</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>2 sets of</p><p>Row, 2km</p><p>40 burpees over rower</p><p>Ski-erg, 30/23 calories</p><p>Rest 5 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to achieve maximum performance in each set, make sure you put equal of higher effort in the second set.
