The challenge is the heavier lifts, you may be able to reach the heaviest load or a lighter load depending on your clean &amp; jerk PR, in any case, try to move fast until that point. Go the double-unders unbroken or unbroken for as long as possible, then catch a breath and continue with the clean &amp; jerks. Go with smooth transitions from DUs to lifts, fast transitions from lifts to DUs. Go the lighter weights (rounds of 15 &amp; 12 reps) with a big touch &amp; go set and then fast single lifts. On the heavier loads (rounds of 9,7 &amp; 5 reps) go with single lifts at a solid tempo. Perform the clean &amp; jerks anyhow you want, yet we recommend you start with powers cleans &amp; touch &amp; go power jerks and then switch to squat cleans and split jerks on the heavier loads</p><p>If you know that a given load is higher than your PR note down the time you finished the lifts of the previous load.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.
