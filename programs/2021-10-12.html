Move fast and explosively through the calories on the assault bike at a pace of 72+ for men / 64+ RPM for women. A good way to go the lifts of each round is by 8 deadlifts, 1 + 6 hang power cleans + 3 shoulders to overhead, then straight to the deadlifts with a short rest between each round taken between deadlifts and hang power cleans. Same for the 2nd part with the heavier weights. The more you manage to keep the 2nd part equal to the 1st part, the better your performance will be.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Engine – Running</b></p><p>6 sets of</p><p>1000 meters @ 3’47”-4’35”/km</p><p>Rest 3 minute between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>15 minutes @ easy pace</p><p><b>Goal &amp; Pace</b></p><p>Select paces within the given time frames that will lead to an intensity of 90-93% of Vo2Max.<b> </b>Walk and regulate your breathing when resting.</p><p><b>Cool down</b></p><p>5 minutes @ very easy pace</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>6 —&gt; 5 —&gt; 4 sets of</p><p>1000 meters @ 3’47”-4’35”/km</p>
