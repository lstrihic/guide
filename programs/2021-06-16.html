The lifts at 70% are 3 times of 1 snatch balance + 3 overhead squats, at 80% are 1 snatch balance + 1 overhead squat. Work on technique and stability. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Power Snatch</strong></p><p>Every 2 Minutes for 10 Minutes (5 sets)</p><p>3 reps @ 85%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up with an empty barbell and progressively increase weight with 3 reps &lt; 70% and 2 reps &lt; 85%. Complete 3 power snatches within a 2-minute time frame and rest until the next 2-minute window starts. Continue in this fashion for 10 minutes in total.</p><p>—</p><p></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>Row, 2000 meters</p><p>60 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>5 legless rope climbs 4,6m – 15ft.</p><p>Row, 1000 meters</p><p>40 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>4 legless rope climbs 4,6m – 15ft.</p><p>Row, 500 meters</p><p>20 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>3 legless rope climbs 4,6m – 15ft.</p><p>Cap: 25 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Row at a fast steady pace, 1:50.0-1:55.0/500m for men | 1:57.0-2:03/500m for women and go straight to the handstand walk (5-meter distances). The challenge in short distances is to consistently dive quickly into each next distance without hesitation so make sure you perform super fast transitions. On the rope climbs, ascend fast using your legs to assist your upper body (kicks or kipping) and descend smoothly by sliding down extending your body and jumping on the ground. Try to breath well on the rower and increase effort as distance decreases.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand walk —&gt; wall-walks 12.8.4 reps (1 wall-walk for each 5-meter portion of handstand walk )</p><p>Leg-less —&gt; regular rope climbs</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 3 sets of</p><p>8 heavy kettlebell sumo deadlifts &gt; 32/24kg – 70/53lb.</p><p>10 double kettlebell shoulder to overhead 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>20 meters, Shoulder rack carry 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>Rest 60 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>6 candlesticks on the ground</p><p>9 parallel bar leg raises</p><p>12 L-sit flutter kicks (parallels)</p><p>Max time, L-sit hold (parallels)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 20/12kg – 44/26lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Back Squat</strong></p><p>2×2 @ 70%</p><p>1×2 @ 75%</p><p>1×2 @ 80%</p><p>1×2 @ 85%</p><p>1×2 @ 90%</p><p>2×2 @ 95%</p><p>1×2 @ 70%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up with sets of 3 reps until you reach 70%.
