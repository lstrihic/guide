Work for a total of 15 minutes. Complete the given number of lifts in each minute and wait until the next minute to start the next set. Increase weight during the 5th and the 10th minute. Go with single lifts at a steady tempo and focus on solid successfully made lifts, ideally finish within 20 seconds in each minute.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>Run, 400 meters</p><p>30 GHD sit-ups</p><p>12 overhead squats 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Pace the first 2 rounds and push the last round harder. Run at a steady pace throughout and avoid any significant pace variances. Ideally, go the GHD sit-ups unbroken, alternatively break the first rounds into a big and a smaller set and go the last round unbroken for as long as possible. The most challenging part is the overhead squats and this is where the difference will be made. If you are comfortable with weightlifting, snatch and continue with solid overhead squats, if not prefer to clean and jerk the barbell to a solid overhead position. In any case the goal is to complete all reps unbroken without losing time and puting effort on re-lifting the barbell overhead.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>GHD sit-ups —&gt; toes to rings</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb. —&gt; 43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

If 12 deficit handstand push-ups is an achievable set for you, then go unbroken for as long as proper form allows, if you find that your form is breaking or you getting significantly slower break, take a breath, and continue with the remaining reps. Alternatively, break from the start into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. On the rope make sure you use your legs, kicks or kipping to assist your upper body, descend smoothly by sliding down (rope between thighs), extending and jumping on the ground.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Deficit —&gt; regular handstand push-ups</p><p>Leg-less —&gt; regular rope climbs</p><p>—</p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>AMRAP 20 Minutes of</p><p>Row, 30/23 calories</p><p>20 bar-facing burpees over</p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Move steadily through the biggest part of the workout, 15+ minutes, then start pushing harder to a max effort finish. Row at 1350+ for men | 1000+ for women with focus on technique and proper breathing, then go straight on the burpees. On the burpees maintain a fast yet sustainable pace throughout the session, increase only if are near the finish. Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, when you break take minimum rest and keep pushing through the remaining reps. Go with smooth transitions.</p>
