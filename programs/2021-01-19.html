The lifts at 60% are 2 sets of 2 power cleans + 2 push presses, at 80% are 1 power clean + 1 push press. Focus on a powerful pull, a solid front rack receiving position and a strong push press. Make sure you utilise your legs to push the barbell overhead and create momentum before you continue with your shoulders. Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 15 Minutes of</p><p>5 clean and jerks 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>10 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>15 box-jumps 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to move constantly and efficiently through the 15 minutes. Maintain a fast yet manageable pace for the biggest part of the workout, 10+ minutes, then if possible increase your pace and go for the strong finish. Prefer to go the clean &amp; jerks with single lifts but make sure you take minimum rest between lifts, go the chest to bar pull-ups unbroken and the box-jumps at a steady, sustainable pace (ideally touch and go). The key is to keep equal transitions between exercises and throughout the workout, the more you are able to keep them fast and equal the better your performance will be. As you reach the finish shorten your transitions and go for touch &amp; go lifts to push yourself to your limits.</p><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>Clean and jerks 52/37kg – 115/80lb <b>→ </b>43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>Pull-ups <b>→</b> assisted pull-ups (band)</p><p>Step-ups 60/50cm – 24/20”</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Work on your pause at the bottom position as you increase weight to better adopt to the specific technique of the movement. Be strict, once you get at the bottom position, make sure you count 1…2..3 before you return to the standing position. Focus on proper form and tempo.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength Stamina – Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>150 wall-balls 9/6kg – 20/14lb.</p><p>15 rope climbs 4,5 meters</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to make a plan to break the 150 wall-balls and 15 rope climbs into sets that will allow you to complete the couplet as fast and as efficiently as you can. That means you can break the reps anyhow you want, perform in any combination and any order as long as you complete the total reps.<b> </b>A good way to go is 5 rope climbs + 50 wall-balls, 4 + 40, 3 +30, 2 + 20, 1 +10 rope climb.

This session consists of 5 sets and each one contains a total 1200-meter distance. Increase your pace as the distance decreases in each set and continue running at a very easy pace when resting. Select paces within the given time frames which you can consistently achieve throughout the whole session (equal performance/pace in each set). Jog for 800 meters as cool down.</p><p>Moderate pace: 4:45-5:30/km</p><p>Moderate to fast pace: 4:15-5:00/km</p><p>Fast pace: 3:45-4:30km</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>5 <b>→</b> 4 sets</p>
