Weight increases and reps decrease but effort remains the same, make sure you rest shortly between sets.</p><p><b>Movements</b></p><p>Ideally go the double-unders unbroken and the overhead squats unbroken for as long as possible. Find and establish a solid overhead position and then move steadily at a solid tempo for as long as you can, break 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching failure, take short to minimum rest and continue.

On the burpees maintain a fast, sustainable pace, as reps decrease with each set try to increase your pace (effort) accordingly. Don’t push too hard from the start considering the extra difficulty of the jump over rower.</p>
