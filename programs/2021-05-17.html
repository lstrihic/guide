Improve explosiveness and the hang position. Focus on a powerful pull and a solid overhead reception. Avoid staying too long at the hang as it taxes your arms and grips unnecessarily.

Complete the couplet of each portion and then wait until the timer reaches the 10:00 and 20:00 minute mark before you start the next portion. Ideally, go each exercise unbroken with smooth transitions between. Alternatively break the high rep rounds into a big and as few smaller sets as possible and try to go the low-rep sets unbroken for as long as you can. Prefer to break the gymnastics and push the barbell as it is less taxing and time consuming.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>B.
