Run at a steady pace throughout the session that will allow you to breathe and go the last run as fast as you can reaching a max effort pace.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Accessory Work</b></p><p>A. 3.6.9.12 reps of</p><p>Barbell bent-over barbell rows 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>Sumo deadlift high pulls 24/16kg – 53/35lb.</p><p>Ring push ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell shoulder to overhead 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>12 double dumbbell step-over box (shoulder carry)</p><p>20 meter, Double dumbbell farmers carry</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>A. 61/43kg – 135/95lb. —&gt; 52/37kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb. —&gt; 16/12kg – 35/26lb.</p><p>B. 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/25lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Barbell Cycling</b></p><p>A.

Go the hang power snatches and overhead squats unbroken at a steady tempo without dropping the barbell on the ground. Then prefer to go the squat snatches with fast single lifts and, as you do that, try to recover your breathing as much as you can. Once you finish the round catch a short breath and continue to the next round in the same fashion.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Engine<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>– Running</b></p><p>3 sets of</p><p>1000 meters @ 3’30”-4’15”km</p><p>Rest 3 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>15 minutes @ progressively increased pace</p><p><b>Goal &amp; Pace</b></p><p>The aim is at promoting Vo2max and lactate threshold.
