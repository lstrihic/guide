Ideally start with a big set and no more than 3-4 smaller sets after that. Go the wall-ball unbroken for as long as you can, take minimum rest and continue with the remaining reps, alternatively break into big manageable sets. Row at a fast pace. +1300 for men/+1100 for women, and move steadily and unbroken on the single-leg squats. If you are comfortable with gymnastics attempt to go unbroken for as long as you can, if not break from the start into a big, and no more than 2-3 smaller sets.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>Bar muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 8.16.24.16.8</p><p>Alternating cossack squats</p><p>Handstand shoulder taps on wall</p><p>Box jumps to pistol</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 super sets of of</p><p>10 double dumbbell hammer curls 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>12 bench dips</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 8.16.24.16.8 —&gt; 6.12.18.12.6 reps of</p><p>B. 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb. —&gt; 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics Conditioning</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>5 strict deficit handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>10 double dumbbell step-ups over 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>10 strict deficit handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>10 double dumbbell step-ups over 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>15 strict deficit handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>10 double dumbbell step-ups over 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>20 strict deficit handstand push-ups 15/10cm – 6/4”</p><p>10 double dumbbell step-ups over 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><b>Warm up</b></p><p>3×10 push-ups</p><p>2×8 double dumbbell deadlifts</p><p>then,</p><p>2 rounds of</p><p>5 strict hand stand push-ups</p><p>6 double dumbbell step-ups over</p><p><b>Goal</b></p><p>Focus on proper form and full range of motion.</p><p><b>Movements</b></p><p>As strict deficit handstand push-ups increase through the workout start breaking into manageable sets, go the double dumbbell step-ups over steadily and unbroken each time.</p><p><b>Options</b></p><p>Strict deficit handstand push-ups —&gt; regular strict handstand push-ups</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/25lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Rowing</strong></p><p>A. 3 sets of</p><p>Row, 1500 meters @ 22 strokes/minute</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between sets</p><p>Pace: 2km PR pace + 16 seconds</p><p>Rest 5 minutes</p><p>B. 2 sets of</p><p>Row, 600 meters @ free rate</p><p>Rest 1 minute between sets</p><p>Pace: 2km PR pace + 7 seconds</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><b>Warm up &amp; Cool down</b></p><p>Row 800 meters at an easy pace before and after the main session</p><p><b>Goal</b></p><p>The session consists of 2 portions, in each portion you have to maintain a certain pace and stroke rate and be consistent throughout the given sets. Make sure you primarily keep steady strokes and then achieve the prescribed time/distance pace. In the second portion strokes are free, find the optimal stroke rate for you considering that more strokes mean higher heart rate and less strokes mean more powerful pulls. Start with fewer strokes and increase.</p>
