Improve power and stability. Focus on a strong pull, an explosive shoulder shrug and a solid overhead position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch High Pull</strong></p><p>5×3 @ 87% of Max Power Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the snatch high pulls from where you left the power snatches. Work on pulling strength and technique (proper angles on the second pull). Focus on a slow, strong starting pull, once the barbel is over the knees increase your speed and finish with an explosive high pull (barbell as high as possible, elbows high). Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 15 Minutes of</p><p>8 strict handstand push-ups</p><p>10 single-arm dumbbell snatches 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>12 step-ups with dumbbell 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to move constantly and efficiently through the 15 minutes. Maintain a fast yet manageable pace for the biggest part of the workout, 10+ minutes, then, if possible increase your pace. Ideally go the strict handstand push-ups unbroken, if you are not comfortable with gymnastics prefer to break from the start into 5-3, 4-4 reps that will allow you to move efficiently. Go the single-arm dumbbell snatches at a fast steady pace. The reps are alternating, prefer to switch arms mid-air for speed. On the step-ups move at a steady pace that will allow you to go unbroken, carry the dumbbell anyhow you want. If needed switch from a shoulder rack position to a hang position etc. The key is to keep equal transitions between exercises and throughout the workout, the more you are able to keep them fast and equal the better your performance. As you reach the finish shorten your transitions and go for the strong finish.<b></b></p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p><b>Masters 40+</b></p><p>Strict handstand push-ups <b>→</b> kipping handstand push-ups</p><p><b>Scaled</b></p><p>Strict handstand push-ups <b>→</b> hand release push-ups</p><p>22,5/15 – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

Move steadily through the 10 rounds. The session will challenge your grips. Ideally go each round of strict ring muscle-ups unbroken, alternatively break into 2-1 or singles depending on your level. On the rope climbs utilise your legs to climb up us efficiently as possible. The more you are able to squat on the rope, the better you keep climbing without having to use your arms and the fresher your grips and forearms are. Make sure you save those grips and forearms as much as possible, you will need them for the muscle-ups.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Strict ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> strict chest to rings pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>6 sets of</p><p>AMRAP 4 Minutes of</p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>300 meters, Row</p><p>15 burpees</p><p>Max calories, Assault bike</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to achieve high performance in each set. Push through the triplet fast and explosively. Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break continue without hesitation immediately with the remaining reps. On the row start explosively and push quickly through the 300 meters, then with a swift transition start the burpees and maintain a fast, sustainable pace. Once you are done with the couplet get on the bike and try to maintain a fast, steady pace for all the remaining time until the 4-minute cap of the round. Transitions between exercises should be swift. The goal is to push fast through the triplet and then maintain the fastest possible pace on the bike, the more remaining time the steadier the pace the less remaining time the faster the pace.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> row</p>
