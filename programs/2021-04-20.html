The lifts at 65% are 2 times of 2 squat cleans + 2 jerks, at 75% are 1 time of 2 squat cleans + 1 jerk. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell, a solid deep squat position, and technical jerks. Prefer to go with split jerks and work on explosiveness and technique, make sure you achieve smooth rebounding on the shoulders. Go with single reps of squat cleans, rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>A.

Move steadily in each AMRAP and increase your pace as you reach the finish. Idealy go each exercise unbroken (touch &amp; go deadlifts) with smooth transitions between that will allow you to do that. Alternatively, break each round into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. If deadlifts feel to heavy don’t hesitate to go with single reps if you realise that you rest too long between sets.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Strict <b>→</b> kipping handstand push-ups</p><p>*Go with kipping if you can’t perform at least 8 strict reps while fresh</p><p>143/91kg – 315/200lb <b>→ </b>125/83kg – 275/185lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.
