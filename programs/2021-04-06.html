Improve explosiveness and stability. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the bar and a solid deep receiving position. Prefer to work on split jerks, go for a powerful push and a steady overhead reception. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>3×3 @ 95% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Same as Monday. Continue to the clean pulls from where you left the squat clean jerks. Improve starting pull strength. Focus on a slow controlled pull with proper lifting angles. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>5 rounds of</p><p>8 deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155lb</p><p>8 strict handstand push-ups</p><p>2 rope climbs</p><p>12 GHD sit-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>We follow the same workout format as on Monday. Start the first round at a fast manageable tempo and try to sustain it throughout the session. Ideally go all exercises unbroken with smooth transitions between, alternatively break the deadlifts and/or the strict handstand push-ups (prefer to break the one that you are not comfortable with) into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between.
