The starting position is with the barbell about 10cm above the knees. Focus on a powerful pull and a solid receiving position. Warm up with an empty barbell and continue with sets of 2-3 reps until you reach 60%. Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Squat clean</strong></p><p>1×2 @ 50%</p><p>1×2 @ 60%</p><p>1×2 @ 70%</p><p>2×1 @ 80%</p><p>2×1 @ 85%</p><p>2×1 @ 90%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Work on explosiveness and confidence.

Ideally go each exercise unbroken, with smooth yet short transitions between them, alternatively break each muscle-up and chest to bar pull-up round into a big and a smaller set, further shortening your transitions. In any case, go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Bar muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

The goal is technical solid lifts and efficient gymnastics. Go the first portion with unbroken power snatches, touch &amp; go, with focus on proper rebounding on the ground and full range of motion. Go the second portion with solid, single lifts. Maintain a steady performance on the barbell throughout the 10 rounds (tempo, rest between lifts and exercises) and go the gymnastics unbroken. Perform smooth transitions that will allow you to move efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 3 <b>→</b> 2 <b>→</b> 1 reps of</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to rings pull-ups</p><p>B. 61/43kg – 135/95kg <b>→</b> 52/35kg – 115/80lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>Run, 8km @ 4’35”-5’15”/km</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run a total distance of 8000 meters.
