Improve technique and explosiveness. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell and a solid overhead position. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch High Pull</strong></p><p>3×2 @ 90%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Start the snatch high pulls from the percentage you stopped the squat snatches. Improve pulling power and lifting angles. Focus on a slow pull until the barbell is over the knees and continue with a faster second pull with the barbell reaching as high as possible. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>18 pull-ups</p><p>9 thrusters 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>*Then</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>12 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>6 thrusters 70/48kg – 155/105lb.</p><p>*Then</p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>6 bar muscle-ups</p><p>3 thrusters 83/54kg – 185/120lb.</p><p>Cap: 15 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This workout consists of 3 consecutive portions, gymnastics difficulty and barbell load increases. The goal is to go each exercise unbroken. The difficulty and load increases but reps decrease so each exercise is manageable enough. Try to be technical on the pull-up bar using (preferably) butterfly or kipping technique. If you need to break prefer to break the gymnastics as these are exercises that you can reposition yourself with less effort.</p><p>*Note your split times</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Bar muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p>52/37kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 single-arm dumbbell power cleans<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>30/20kg – 65/45lb.</p><p>20 meters, Dumbbell farmers carry </p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>(in each set switch arms from clean to carry)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>3 sets of</p><p>10 barbell inverse curls</p><p>15 double dumbbell reverse flys</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>30/20kg – 65/45lb —&gt; 25/15kg – 55/35lb —&gt; 20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb.</p><p>12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>36 GHD sit-ups</p><p>36 single-leg squats</p><p>12 shoulders to overhead 83/54kg – 185/120lb.</p><p>42 GHD sit-ups</p><p>42 single-leg squats</p><p>8 shoulders to overhead 83/54kg – 185/120lb.</p><p>48 GHD sit-ups</p><p>48 single-leg squats</p><p>4 shoulders to overhead 83/54kg – 185/120lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and steady tempo. Go the GHD sit ups unbroken for as long as possible, if you break take a short breath and continue with the rest of the reps. On the singe-unders maintain a steady tempo throughout the session. Ideally go the shoulders to overhead unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short rest between, focus on smooth rebounding on the shoulders.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>83/54kg – 185/120lb. —&gt; 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A. 2 sets of&nbsp;</p><p>Row, 500 meters @ 24 strokes/minute</p><p>Rest 2 minutes between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.&nbsp;5 sets of</p><p>Row, 1250 meters @ 24 strokes/minute</p><p>Rest 2 minutes &amp; 30 seconds&nbsp;</p><p>Pace: 2km PR pace + 12 seconds</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up by rowing 2 sets at light pressure and 24 strokes before you start the main session.

Cool down rowing 500 meters at very light pressure.</p>
