Start by pacing the first section and push the fewer reps second section really hard. Row at 1350+ for men / 1100+ for women, then go the wall-ball shots unbroken for as long as you can breaking 2-3 reps before you reach failure. Prefer to break the toes to bar into a big and some smaller sets with short to minimum rest between. Go the front rack lunges by 7,5-meter unbroken distances, focus on proper and solid repetitions. On the lower-rep section try to maintain equal pace on the rower and give all you got to go all other exercises unbroken. </p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>9/6kg – 20/14lb → 7/4 – 16/10lb</p><p>Toes to bar → knees to elbows</p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb → 50/34kg – 110/75lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Alternate between high-rep sets at a steady 50% percentage and single reps with increasing load up to 90% of max.

On the single lifts focus on solid, successfully made lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Max Effort</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>3 legless rope climbs</p><p>2 thrusters 70/45kg – 155/100lb</p><p>2 legless rope climbs</p><p>4 thrusters 70/45kg – 155/100lb</p><p>1 legless rope climb</p><p>6 thrusters 70/45kg – 155/100lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Move fast from the start and keep pushing hard until the finish. On the legless rope climbs ascend fast with swift, solid grasps and coordinated leg movements. Even bigger role play the descents, make sure you are technical and go with sliding, extending body and letting go of the rope. Ideally, go the thrusters unbroken for as long as possible with a short pause at the top position if you need to momentarily catch your breath. Alternatively break the 6 or 4-rep round into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Leg-less → regular rope climbs</p><p>70/45kg – 155/100lb → 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>2000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’40”-5’40”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’20”-5’20”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’00”-5’00”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>1000 meters @ 3’40”-4’40”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run a total distance of 10000 meters in which pace alternates between easy and progressively increased.
