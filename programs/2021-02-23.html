Break the<b> </b>handstand push-ups and chest to bar pull-ups into big manageable sets with short to minimum rest between. On the box-jump overs and single arm dumbbell snatches move steadily at a fast yet sustainable pace. Ideally go the box-jump overs touch &amp; go, make sure your tempo allows you to do that efficiently. The snatches are alternating, prefer to perform the transitions in mid-air for extra speed. Ideally, once you have completed the biggest part of the AMRAP, 15+ minutes, start pushing harder, attempt to go unbroken for as long as possible, breaking 1-2 reps before muscle failure and shorten even more the transitions between exercises.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Handstand push-ups <b>→</b> push-ups hand release</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

The load increases yet each next movement can be performed consistently more easily so your effort should remain the same. Ideally, go unbroken for as long as proper form allows, make sure you utilise your legs and keep a proper form and a solid posture as you execute the lifts. Especially, on the no touch power snatches focus on driving the barbell to the ground smoothly and with control so as not to tax your back. Alternatively break into big, manageable sets that will ensure a fast, sustainable tempo.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>5 rounds of</p><p>10 strict pull-ups</p><p>2 rope climbs</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and full range of motion.
