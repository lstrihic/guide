Improve explosiveness and stability. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position.

The single arm dumbbell hang clean &amp; presses are alternating, be technical and focus on movement mechanics to drive the dumbbell overhead and to the hang position. Try to move steadily and constantly with the dumbbells at a steady tempo since it is the final exercise, perform mid-air transitions preferably at shoulder height.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Single-leg squats —&gt; goblet squats with dumbbell</p><p>30/20kg – 65/45lb —&gt; 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 2.4.8.4.2 reps of</p><p>Cross body kettlebell deadlifts 20/12kg – 44/26lb → 16/8kg – 35/18lb</p><p>Kettlebell goblet cyclist squats</p><p>Kettlebell windmills</p><p><b></b></p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>8 dumbbell pullovers 30/20kg – 65/45lb</p><p>10 barbell bicep curls</p><p>12 double dumbbell chest flys 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/17,5lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 24/16kg – 53/35lb —&gt;<b> </b>20/12kg – 44/26lb —&gt; 16/8kg – 35/18lb</p><p>B. 30/20kg – 65/45lb —&gt; 25/15kg – 55/35lb —&gt; 20/12,5kg – 45/27,5lb</p><p>12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/17,5lb —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb —&gt; 7,5/2,5kg – 17,5/5lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>40.30.20.10 reps of</p><p>Double kettlebell Russian swings 24/16kg – 53/35lb</p><p>20 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and quality of movements. Ideally go the Russian swing unbroken for as long as proper form allows with focus on movement mechanics and full hip activation. Alternatively break the high-rep sets from the start into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Break the handstand walk into 2×10 meters unbroken distances, move fast on your hands with quick steps and focus on a proper handstand position (toes pointing upwards, straight legs, tight core and shoulders).</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb —&gt; 20/12kg – 45/26lb.</p><p>Handstand walk —&gt; 4 wall-walks</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.&nbsp;Row 4 minutes @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A2.

In the main session try to maintain high performance (given pace) and most importantly equal strokes in each set. 26 strokes per minute is a moderate pace ideal for focus on technique. Cool down rowing at very light pressure after the session.</p>
