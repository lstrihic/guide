Work on technique and explosiveness. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid bottom position. The lightweight sets allow you to really focus on technique and quality. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Squat Clean &amp; Jerk</strong></p><p>2×2+2 @ 50%</p><p>2×2+1 @ 60%</p><p>1×2+1 @ 65%</p><p>1×2+1 @ 70%</p><p>3×3+3 @ 75%</p><p>1×5+1 @ 65%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up with an empty barbell and progressively increase weight with sets of 2 squat cleans + 2 jerks until you reach 50%.

On the burpees maintain a fast, sustainable pace throughout the workout. The thrusters should be performed unbroken, if you have to choose, prefer to break the power cleans and go the thrusters unbroken. In any case push the last round harder by increasing your pace and shortening your transitions. Consider that the barbell is lightweight and if you have the capacity to go unbroken, transitions will play the biggest role to your performance.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>8 double kettlebell sumo deadlifts 32/24kg – 70/53lb</p><p>6 double kettlebell cleans</p><p>4 double kettlebell shoulders to overhead</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>Max time, Weighted hollow hold, 5kg – 10lb plate hands │ 2,5kg – 5lb dumbbell legs</p><p>Immediately into,</p><p>20 crossover crunches (10 each side)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>32/24kg – 70/53lb → 24/16kg – 53/35lb → 20/12kg – 44/26lb</p><p>Weighted hollow hold <b>→ </b>bodyweight hollow hold</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Front Squat</strong></p><p>1×5 @ 65%</p><p>1×4 @ 70%</p><p>1×3 @ 75%</p><p>1×2 @ 80%</p><p>5×1 @ 85%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Build up with sets of 4-5 reps until you reach 65%.

Alternatively, go the GHD unbroken for as long as possible and break the toes to bar into fast, smaller sets with minimum rest between. In any case it will be a challenge for your core and you might reach failure at some point. Make sure you don’t go all out from the start and don’t hesitate to break into really small, fast sets if needed.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>GHD sit-ups <b>→</b> weighted sit-ups (med-ball)</p><p>Toes to bar <b>→</b> knees to chest</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.

Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, when you break take a breath and immediately continue with the remaining exercises. On the ergs maintain a steady, sustainable pace that will allow you to breath well. The difference between the bike and the row is that you should move fast on the bike yet partially recover, regulate your breathing and continue strong to the double-unders. In the case of the row you should pace the first meters, push through the double-unders as efficiently as possible and then maintain the fastest sustainable pace in the last meters.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> bike-erg <b>→</b> row</p>
