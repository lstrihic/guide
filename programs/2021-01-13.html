The lifts at 70% are 3 sets of 1 power clean + 3 jerks, at 80% are 2 sets of 1 power clean + 2 jerks. Focus on a powerful pull, an explosive jerk and solid receiving positions. Work on touch &amp; go jerks, immediately go for a power jerk once you load the barbel to the front rack.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>10.20.30.40.50 reps of</p><p>Single-arm dumbbell ground to overhead 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>15 toes to bar</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Maintain a fast, steady tempo on the ground to overheads, the more technically you perform the lifts the more efficiently you will push through the total volume.

There are 4 portions, each one increases load on the bar. Thrusters is an exercise in which you need to keep moving without breaking much and dropping the bar on the ground. Ideally go each portion unbroken for as long as possible, alternatively break (especially the heavier portions) into no more than 2-3 sets with short rest between. Consider that the session is partially a For time workout, perform fast transitions between weight increases yet make sure you rest enough to go for an unbroken set.</p><p><b>—<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>30 ring muscle-ups</p><p>*Every time you break perform 15 meters handstand walk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Ideally, go the ring muscle-ups unbroken for as long as possible, break 1-2 reps before you feel you will reach a failed attempt, alternatively make a plan to break into as few manageable sets as possible. Place two marks to create a 7,5 meter distance for the handstand walk, go back and forth this distance every time you break and come down from the rings. Move fast with short and quick steps considering that the less you stay on the handstand position the less you tax your shoulders and upper body.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>30 <b>→</b> 25 <b>→</b> 20 reps of</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>15 <b>→</b> 10 meters of handstand walk <b>→</b> 2 wall-walks</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>3 rounds of</p><p>Row, 1500 meters</p><p>Ski-erg, 1000 meters</p><p>50 GHD sit-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Maintain a fast, steady pace on both row and ski with focus on breathing well. Start smoothly and increase your pace with each round up to a really challenging pace in the last one. On the GHD sit-ups try to go unbroken for as long as possible, break 1-2 reps before failure, take a short to minimum rest and continue with the remaining reps.
