Improve explosiveness and stability. Use racks or blocks and focus on an explosive push and a solid deep receiving position. The percentages are high so prefer to perform and work on your split jerks. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>2 sets of</p><p>AMRAP 8 Minutes of</p><p>2.4.6.8…etc reps of</p><p>Power cleans 70/50kg – 155/110lb.</p><p>Double dumbbell thrusters 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>Bar muscle-ups</p><p>Rest 4 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to achieve maximum performance in each set. Prefer to go with single lifts and maintain a fast and super steady tempo as reps with each round increase. Instead, really focus on going the double dumbbell thrusters unbroken for as long as possible (stop ideally 1-2 reps before failure). Alternatively, once reps of each round get more than you can handle break the thrusters into a big and smaller set with short to minimum rest between. On the muscle ups go the low-rep rounds unbroken and have a plan of breaking the high-rep rounds into manageable sets (depending on your level) that will allow you to push through the total volume efficiently. Don’t expect your performance to be equal, give your best to push through each set as efficiently as possible.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>70/50kg – 155/110lb <b>→</b> 60/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

So the more you succeed in maintaining a steady tempo throughout each portion the better your performance will be. Go for a touch &amp; go set only when you reach the finish of each portion if you feel like challenging yourself and pushing your limits.</p><p>*Rest 3 minutes between portions.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>3 L-sit rope climbs*</p><p>6 leg-less rope climbs</p><p>9 regular rope climbs</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Work on efficiency.
