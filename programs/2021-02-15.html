Improve explosiveness and stability. Focus on a powerful push, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position. Use racks or high blocks.

The single arm dumbbell snatches are alternating. Go at a fast tempo, make sure you are technical and perform the arm switches in mid-air. On the double-unders go unbroken for as long as possible, when you break immediately continue without rest performing the remaining reps. The goal is to perform fast transitions, the more you are able to keep your transitions fast and equal throughout, the better your performance will be.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb <b>→</b> 15/10kg – 35/25lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.
