The volume of the lifts decreases with each part and the load increases yet your effort should remain the same. Go the box-jumps at a steady, sustainable pace (ideally touch &amp; go), prefer to go the power snatches with single lifts but make sure you keep minimum rest between reps. Ideally push the toes to bar unbroken, alternatively break from the start into sets (7-5, 6-6) that will allow you to keep moving efficiently. The challenge will be the hang squat snatches, ideally go unbroken for as long as possible, drop only 1-2 reps before failure. Focus on technique and a solid deep receiving position. Alternatively, make a plan to break from the start into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. The less you drop the bar, the better. Push harder as you reach the finish of each part attempting the unbroken and shortening the transitions.</p><p><b>Masters:</b></p><p>C. 70/47,5kg – 155/105lb.</p><p><b>Scale:</b></p><p>B. 52/37kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>C. 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>8 dumbbell hip thrusts 20/15kg – 45/35lb</p><p>12-15 tricep dips</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4 sets of</p><p>12-15 push-ups</p><p>8 double dumbbell bicep curls 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>20/15kg – 45/35lb → 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb → 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>30 strict handstand push-ups</p><p>30 deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155lb.</p><p>30 kipping handstand push-ups</p><p>30 deadlifts 143/90kg – 315/200lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Focus on proper form and full range of motion. Make a plan to break each exercise into sets that will allow you to move efficiently through the total volume. The start with the handstand push-ups makes the whole workout a challenge. Prefer to break them into manageable sets (ideally no more than 6 in total) with short to minimum rest between, in any case make sure you don’t push too hard too early. In the same way break the deadlifts and kipping handstand push-ups (focus on fast reps with good kipping technique) into a big and some smaller manageable sets with short rest between. On the heavy deadlifts consider that sets will be smaller yet make sure you keep short rest between, don’t hesitate to go with single reps as you reach the end if needed.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>143/90kg – 315/200lb <b>→</b> 124/80kg – 275/175lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>5 sets of</p><p>Ski-erg, 500 meters @ easy to moderate pace</p><p>Ski-erg, 500 meters @ moderate pace</p><p>Ski-erg, 500 meters @ moderate to fast pace</p><p>Rest 3 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Work on your tempo.
