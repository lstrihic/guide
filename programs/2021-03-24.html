Ideally go unbroken with touch and go reps, especially on the light-load rounds (10, 8 reps). On the heavier loads prefer to go with solid, single lifts with short to minimum rest between. Increase weight on the barbell on your own, practice on fast and efficient weight changes.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 15 Minutes of</p><p>Row, 14/12 calories</p><p>8 shoulders to overhead 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>Row, 14/12 calories</p><p>8 hang squat cleans 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Maintain a steady pace for the biggest part of the workout and then start pushing harder by shortening your transitions and in-between rest. Row at a fast steady pace, 1350+ for men / 1100+ for women and try to go the shoulders to overhead and hang squat cleans unbroken. Alternatively, break the shoulders to overhead into a big and a smaller set with short rest between and go the hang squat cleans unbroken for as long as possible.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→ </b>52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A.
