Focus on a solid hang position and an explosive pull. Go either with hang power snatches or hang squat snatches, the challenge is to be able to switch from power to squat snatches efficiently if you need to. Warm up with an empty barbell and continue with sets of 2 power snatches + 1 hang power snatch + 1 hang squat snatch until you reach 55%. Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch balance + overhead squat</strong></p><p>1×2+1 @ 50% of Snatch balance</p><p>1×2+1 @ 60%</p><p>1×1+1 @ 70%</p><p>1×1+1 @ 75%</p><p>1×1+1 @ 80%</p><p>1×1+1 @ 85%</p><p>3×1+2 @ 90%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Improve stability.

Ideally go with 11 deadlifts, 1 deadlift + 9 hang power cleans + 6 shoulders to overhead and then attempt an unbroken 15-meter handstand walk. Alternatively break into 11 deadlifts, 1 deadlift + 8 hang power cleans, 1 hang power clean + 6 shoulders to overhead and go the handstand walk with 7,5 meter unbroken distances.

In the main session try to achieve high and equal performance throughout. Focus on achieving a 2km PR pace + 4 seconds in each set. Strokes are free, if you choose to go with fewer strokes you rely on power, if you choose to go with more strokes you rely on cardio. Row 5 minutes at very low pressure as cool-down.</p>
