Continue to the 3 rounds by moving steadily through the exercises. Go the wall-balls unbroken, break the toes to bar into a big and a smaller set with minimum rest between. Prefer to perform solid single lifts at a fast tempo and attempt unbroken bar muscle-up sets. On the last run give everything you got.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>83/61kg – 180/135lb. —&gt; 70/52kg – 155/115lb.</p><p>Bar muscle-ups —&gt; chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with chest to bar pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 5 unbroken bar muscle-ups while fresh.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10</p><p>Double dumbbell deadlifts 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>Double dumbbell shoulder to overhead</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>10 double dumbbell bicep curls 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>15 double dumbbell tricep kickbacks 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>10 burpee step-ups with dumbbells 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb. —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>B. 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb. —&gt; 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb.</p><p>10/5kg – 22,5/10lb. —&gt; 7,5/2,5kg – 15/5lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics Conditioning</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>30 ring muscle-ups</p><p>30 meters, Shoulders rack lunges 2×22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>300 double-unders</p><p>20 ring muscle-ups</p><p>20 meters, Shoulders rack lunges 2×22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>200 double-unders</p><p>10 ring muscle-ups</p><p>10 meters, Shoulders rack lunges 2×22,5/15kg – 50/35lb.</p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>Cap: 30 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to push efficiently through the muscle-ups with sets that will tackle a failed attempt and allow you to push through the total volume without excessive rest between breaks. Go the muscle-ups with manageable sets, &gt; 5 reps. Break the shoulders rack lunges into 10-meter unbroken distances, focus on a solid position and steady lunges throughout the distances. Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as possible, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps. Instead of pushing harder with each round, prefer to be consistent through the session and push steadily without long breaks.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ring muscle-ups —&gt; ring dips —&gt; ring push-ups</p><p>*Choose an option that you can easily perform 10 unbroken reps while fresh.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Rowing</strong></p><p>A1.&nbsp;Row 1000 meters @ 22-24 strokes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A2.

In the main session go for a 2000 meter official time trial. Go with free strokes and try to achieve maximum performance. This is an important session as it designates the reference point of the given paces that you work with through your training cycles.</p>
