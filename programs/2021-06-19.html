In the 15 minutes you have to warm up properly and build up to the max with as few sets as possible, so prefer to start going with singles early. Once you reach a failed attempt, give your self an extra 2 attempts. if you fail all three attempts your session is over. Finish the session with 3 single lifts at 75% of your max lift.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>27.21.15.9 reps of</p><p>Deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155lb.</p><p>Handstand push-ups</p><p>Cap: 8 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to break the high rep round smartly and push the low-rep rounds harder. Break the exercise that you are not that comfortable with into no more than 2-3 sets with short to minimum rest between. As reps get fewer attempt to go unbroken for as long as possible, if/when you break take minimum rest and continue with the remaining reps.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>102/70kg – 225/155lb. —&gt; 83/61kg – 180/135lb.</p><p>Handstand push-ups —&gt; push-ups hand release</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

The recommended weight is 200/130kg – 440/280lb yet a heavy load that makes you struggle will do the job. Go with short steady steps and move unbroken for as long as you can, take advantage of all the available space you have so you dont have to break the total distance into many smaller distances.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Max Effort – Grettel</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>10 rounds of</p><p>3 clean jerks 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>3 bar-facing burpees over</p><p>Cap: 4 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>This is a sprint. Complete the lifts fast and then immediately continue to the burpees. The goal is to efficiently maintain a steady pace throughout the session, equal time of completion of each round. Ideally go the lifts unbroken with touch and go technique, alternatively go with single lifts at a really fast tempo, drop,stabilise, lift. repeat.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>A. 2400 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 10 rounds of</p><p>100 meters @ 85-95% of Max effort</p><p>300 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up by running 2400 meters prior to the session and cool down for 1600 meters afterwards at a comfortable pace of your choice. Perform 30-meter distances of front swings, side cross swings, front leg raise toe taps etc and finish with 3 sets of 50 meter sprints. Start from 85% of Max effort (100 meters) and increase to a pace near 95% of Max effort. Don’t push each set to your limits, the aim is to focus on sprint mechanics and be consistent throughout. Jog for 300 meters in order to recover your breathing.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>10 <b>→</b> 8 <b>→</b> 6 rounds* of</p><p>100 meters @ 85-95% of Max effort</p><p>300 meters @ easy pace</p><p>*Stop if your 100-meter pace slows down more than 2 seconds</p>
