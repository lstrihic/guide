Work on technique and explosiveness. Focus on an explosive pull, a fast drive under the barbell and a solid bottom position. The lightweight sets allow you to really focus on technique and quality. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>3×3 @ 95% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pulls from where you left the squat cleans. Work on pulling strength. Focus on a slow, strong starting pull and an explosive shoulder shrug. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean High Pull</strong></p><p>2×5 @ 85%</p><p>2×4 @ 95%</p><p>2×3 @ 105%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Finish the weightlifting of the day with an even more technical pull. Perform in the same way as the clean pulls but continue with a high pull, elbow pointing upwards and over the barbell, barbell pulled vertically and as high as possible. Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 10 Minutes of</p><p>15 burpee box jumps 60/50cm</p><p>25 deadlifts 102/70kg – 225/155lb</p><p>15 burpee box jumps 60/50cm</p><p>25 deadlifts 124/80kg – 270/175lb</p><p>15 burpee box jumps 60/50cm</p><p>25 deadlifts 142/90kg – 315/200lb</p><p>15 burpee box jumps 60/50cm</p><p>Max reps, deadlifts 165/100kg – 360/220lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Maintain a fast yet sustainable pace on the burpee box jumps throughout the workout. The challenge is the deadlifts, with this high volume of deadlifts you have to go with a plan to break each round into manageable sets of touch and go reps that will allow you to keep pushing efficiently without overly resting when you break or between exercises. Go with a big first set and then some smaller sets with short rest between. Consider that the load on the barbell increases and your sets should be even smaller, anyhow make sure you keep the in-between rest to the minimum. When you reach the heavy weight on the Max-rep set break into small, manageable sets and try to lift as much as possible even if that means going with single lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

On the cleans and the shoulders to overhead make sure you keep proper angles and efficient kettlebell technique. Go unbroken for as long as proper form allows, alternatively break from the start into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Work in the same way on the chest to bars and strict handstand push-ups, ideally go unbroken, alternatively break into a big and a smaller set. In any case, take adequate rest between exercises that will allow you to perform each movement efficiently.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>24/16kg – 53/35lb <b>→</b> 20/12kg – 44/26lb</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups<b> →</b> pull-ups</p><p>Strict handstand push-ups <b>→ </b>pike push-ups (elevated feet)</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.
