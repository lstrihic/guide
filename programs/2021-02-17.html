Try to complete all the exercises unbroken without falling of the pull up bar. In order to achieve that, go the pull-ups and chest to bar pull-ups with butterfly technique considering that the faster you push through the reps the less you will be hanging of the pull up bar and the more chances you will have to complete the complex. Emphasize on smooth transitions between kipping technique (toes to bar) — butterfly technique (pull-ups, CH2B) — keeping technique (muscle-ups). If butterfly is not possible go all the movements with kipping technique and unbroken for as long as possible.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>20.15.10.5 <b>→</b> 16.12.8.4 reps</p><p>Or</p><p>15 toes to bar</p><p>10 pull-ups</p><p>5 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>4 sets of</p><p>Ski, 500 meters</p><p>Row, 500 meters</p><p>Bike-erg, 1000 meters</p><p>*Start a new set every 12 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Work for a total volume of about 45-48 minutes.

Transitions will play a big role on your performance, focus on fast transitions that will allow you complete each set fast and efficiently.</p><p><strong>Option</strong></p><p>Ski <b>→</b> run, 400 meters</p><p>Bike-erg <b>→</b> run, 400 meters</p>
