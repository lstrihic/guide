The load on the barbell increases in each part yet reps decrease. Ideally go each exercise unbroken and perform smooth transitions between them that will allow you to achieve that. Alternatively break into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. If you need to break prefer to break the overhead squats and not the toes to bars since the effort to reposition on the overhead squats is bigger. *Each time lift the barbell from the ground.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 1 attempt of Max unbroken pegboard ascents</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4 sets of</p><p>20 meters, Barbell back rack carry @ As heavy as proper form allows</p><p>20 weighted kettlebell single-leg squats 20/12kg – 44/26lb</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A.

It is a repeated triplet with the second time having half the reps of the first time. In the 1st triplet go with a big set and some smaller sets with short rest between. On the second triplet try to go unbroken for as long as possible, break 1-2 reps before you feel like reaching muscle failure, take minimum rest and continue.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A1.
