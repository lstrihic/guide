Go the bar-facing burpees over at a steady sustainable pace throughout the session. The goal is to go the overhead squats/front squats unbroken and the power snatches/clean and jerks unbroken as well using touch and go technique. If not possible for unbroken, prefer to go the 1st and 2nd round with single lifts of power snatches/clean and jerks with minimum rest between and attempt to go touch and go the last set if you feel confident enough.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>12 seated dumbbell goblet good mornings 20/15kg – 45/35lb.</p><p>10 single-arm dumbbell overhead presses</p><p>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 5.10.15.10.5 reps of</p><p>Double dumbbell hammer curls 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15kg</p><p>Dips on the parallel bar</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 20/15kg – 45/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>B. 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb. —&gt; 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strongman Conditioning</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>Run, 200 meters</p><p>20 meters, Sandbag bear hug carry 70/50kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>Run, 200 meters</p><p>40 meters, Sandbag bear hug carry 70/50kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>Run, 200 meters</p><p>60 meters, Sandbag bear hug carry 70/50kg – 115/80lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Run at a steady sustainable pace throughout the session with focus on breathing well.

On the snatches try to maintain a fast sold tempo that will allow you to keep moving efficiently, reps are alternating.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>30/22,5kg – 70/50lb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>—&gt; 22,5/15kg / 50/35lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine – Running</strong></p><p>A. 2000 meters @ easy pace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 1000 meters @ 4’30”-5’20”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’20”-5’10”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’10”-5’00”/km</p><p>1000 meters @ 4’00”-4’50”/m</p><p>1000 meters @ Max effort</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Warm up by running 2000 meters prior the main session and cool down by running 400 meters afterwards at a comfortable pace of your choice.
