The most challenging part is the overhead squats, find a solid overhead position and try to move consistently throughout the total reps. Ideally go all other exercises unbroken for as long as possible, take minimum rest and continue. Alternatively, break the shoulders to overhead and/or deadlifts into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb. —&gt; 15/10kg – 35/25lb.</p><p>GHD sit-ups —&gt; toes to rings</p><p>—</p><p></p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>12 double dumbbell incline bench press 20/15kg – 45/35lb.</p><p>2 peg board ascents</p><p>60 seconds, Wall squat hold</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 20.15.10.5</p><p>Weighted single leg goblet squats 16/12kg – 35/26lb.</p><p>Double kettlebell swings</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 20/15kg – 45/35lb. — &gt; 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb.</p><p>2 peg board ascents —&gt; 8 pegboard pull-ups</p><p>B. 16/12kg – 35/26lb. —&gt; 12/8kg – 26/18lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Barbell Cycling</strong></p><p>AMRAP 10 Minutes of</p><p>10 snatches 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>Rest 1 minute</p><p>10 snatches 83/52kg<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>– 180/115lb.</p><p>Rest 1 minute</p><p>10 snatches 102/61kg – 225/135lb.</p><p>Rest 1 minute</p><p>Max snatches 111/70kg – 245/155lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The difficulty is increasing as weight is added on the barbell and tax is accumulating. It is recommended that you start with power snatches and then switch to squat snatches as the barbell gets heavier. Ideally, go the lightweight snatches unbroken with touch and go power snatches, alternatively break into no more than 2-3 touch and go sets. Go the second part unbroken for as long as possible and continue with single lifts with minimum rest between. Go the third part with solid single lifts at a steady tempo, take adequate rest in order to ensure successfully made snatches. When/If you reach the last part, gather your strength build your confidence and attempt solid successfully made lifts.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>10 reps @ 60% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>Rest 1 minute</p><p>10 reps @ 70%</p><p>Rest 1 minute</p><p>10 reps @ 80%</p><p>Rest 1 minute</p><p>Max reps @ 90%</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics Complex</strong></p><p>3 sets of</p><p>5 toes to bar</p><p>5 pull-ups</p><p>5 toes to bar</p><p>5 chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>5 toes to bar</p><p>5 bar muscle-ups</p><p>Rest as needed between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Each set is a complex, try to go all movements unbroken.
