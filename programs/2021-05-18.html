Improve explosiveness and the hang position. Focus on a powerful pull and a solid front rack reception. Avoid staying too long at the hang as it taxes your arms and grips unnecessarily.

Adjust a treadmill or find a route with incline (5-10%). Work at 80% of Max effort, you will find that the incline will increase the difficulty on your leg work and breathing, changing your common running pace (expect your legs to feel really heavy!). Walk back between sprints and finish the session with a 800 meters jog.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>8 —&gt; 7 —&gt; 6 sets of</p><p>60 seconds, Incline sprint @ 80%</p>
