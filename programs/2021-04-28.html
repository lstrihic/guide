Improve power and jerk technique. Focus on a powerful pull and a solid, technical jerk. Prefer to work on split jerk as it is a chance to improve your technique, in any case you can go with either split or power jerks. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>3 sets of</p><p>For time</p><p>15/12 calories, Row</p><p>7 hang power snatches 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>12 bar facing burpees over</p><p>7 power snatches 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>Rest 3 minutes between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Try to achieve high performance in each set. Move explosively on the rower and push quickly through the calories, ideally go the hang power snatches and power snatches unbroken, alternatively go the power snatches unbroken for as long as possible and continue with single lifts with minimum rest between. In any case go for an unbroken set of hang power snatches as it will be costful to drop.
