The lifts at 60% are 1 set of 3 squat cleans + 2 jerks, at 70% are 2 sets of 2 squat cleans + 1 jerk. Focus on a fast drive under the bar, an explosive jerk and solid receiving positions. Go with single lifts on the squat cleans. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 10 seconds between squat cleans.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pulls</strong></p><p>3×3 @ 95% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Continue to the clean pulls from where you left the squat clean + jerks. Work on pulling strength. Focus on a slow, strong starting pull and an explosive shoulder shrug. Go with single lifts, rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 5 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>A.

Ideally got both exercises unbroken with smooth transitions to the thrusters and faster transition from the thrusters to the other exercise. Alternatively prefer to break the exercise that you struggle more with (depending on whether you are comfortable with weights or gymnastics) into a big and smaller set with minimum rest between. In any case, if you need to break, it is better to break the toes to bar than the thrusters, it is less taxing to reposition.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>C.
