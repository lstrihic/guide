Improve maximal strength and confidence. There is a total of 10 sets, go with a set every minute in EMOM style. Complete the lift and then wait until the next minute starts to continue with the next lift. Focus on o fast drive under the barbell and a solid deep receiving position.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snatch Pull</strong></p><p>5×1 @ 100% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Go straight to the snatch pull from the weight that you left the squat snatch.

Move at two tempos, maintain a steady pace until you complete the 40 meters of lunges and the start pushing harder to go for the strong finish. Go the GHD sit-ups unbroken for as long as you can, if you break take minimum rest and continue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Ideally go the wall-balls and the toes to bar unbroken, alternatively break from the start into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. On the single arm dumbbell overhead lunges break into 10-meter unbroken distances with focus on a solid overhead position and steady tempo.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

The goal in the main session is to be consistent in each set maintaining steady strokes and pace for each 2500-meter distance. In part B1 keep steady 24 strokes and try to achieve a 2km PR pace +16 seconds, in the B2 part 22 strokes and 2km PR pace + 14 seconds and in the B3 part 20 strokes and 2km PR pace + 12 seconds. Cool down by rowing 4 minutes at very light pressure.</p>
