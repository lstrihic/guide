The lifts at 65% are 2 times of 2 power cleans + 2 push presses, at 75% 1 time of 2 power cleans + 1 push press. Focus on powerful pulls and pushes. Go with singles on the power cleans and touch &amp; go push presses. Make sure you achieve smooth rebounding on the shoulders and are not doing jerks.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>AMRAP 20 Minutes of</p><p>Row, 20/15 calories</p><p>20 wall-ball shots 9/6kg – 20/14lb</p><p>Row, 20/15 calories</p><p>20 handstand push-ups</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to move steadily through the biggest part of the workout and then start pushing harder up to max effort when you are near the finish. In any case row at a steady pace throughout, 1350+ for men / 1050+ for women. Ideally, go the wall-ball shots and handstand push-ups unbroken, alterantively break the handstand push-ups into a big and a smaller set. Perform fast transitions and try to reach your intended pace as fast as possible once you sit on the rower.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A.

Go with single lifts, do not rush since the game is on once you reach the heavy lifts, make sure you move steadily and keep short equal rest between lifts throughout the session. The more you achieve keeping resting periods between heavy lifts equal to those of lightweight lifts the better your performance will be.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>AMRAP 10 Minutes of</p><p>1.2.3.4..etc reps of</p><p>Rope climbs</p><p>9/7 calories, Ski-erg</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Work on rope climbing efficiency. The pressure will be all on your upper body so make sure you get very technical. Perform fast transitions from rope climbs to the ski and smooth transitions from ski to rope climbs. On the rope climbs, ascend by finding solid footing and squatting on the rope. Enable as much as you can your legs to assist you arms. Descend by sliding down and keeping the rope wrapped around your feet and close to your body.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Ski-erg <b>→</b> row</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine</strong></p><p>A.
