Go the double-unders unbroken for as long as you can, if you break immediately continue with the remaining reps. On the overhead squats try to go each round unbroken with a solid overhead position and steady tempo, if you manage to do that you will save a lot of time and avoid extra taxing. If not possible, break into a big and a smaller set with short rest between. Go the first two rounds of burpees at a fast sustainable tempo and go the last round as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>52/37kg – 115/80lb. —&gt; 43/30kg – 95/65lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core strength</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>10 landmine goblet cossack squats 20/10kg – 45/25lb. plate</p><p>10 tall kneeling landmine presses</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B.4 sets of</p><p>20 panther plank shoulder taps</p><p>20 seconds, Arch hold</p><p>20 plank hip dips</p><p>20 arch rocks</p><p>Rest as needed between exercises</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>20/10kg – 45/25lb. —&gt; 10/7kg – 25/15lb.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Back Squat</strong></p><p>2×2 @ 70% + 8 box-jumps</p><p>2×2 @ 75% + 8 box-jumps</p><p>2×2 @ 80% + 8 box-jumps </p><p>2×2 @ 85% + 8 box-jumps </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>At each percentage complete 2 sets.
