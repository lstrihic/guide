Improve stability and confidence. Focus on a fast drive under the barbell and solid receiving positions on both clean and jerk movements. The lifts at 80% is 2 sets of 2 squat clean jerks, at 90% is 1 set of 1 squat clean and 2 jerks. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clean Pull</strong></p><p>2×2 @ 100% of Max Squat Clean</p><p>2×2 @ 105%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Start the clean pull from where you left the squat clean + jerk.

The goal is to be technical on the rope and perform the reps as comfortably as possible and equally important perform fast transitions between exercises. Go the exercises unbroken with focus on breathing well, shorten your transitions as you reach the end. Work with the vest, make sure you adjust it tight to your body so it doesn’t move around excessively.</p><p>—</p><p></p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 4 sets of</p><p>6 barbell bent over rows 61/43kg – 135/95lb.</p><p>12 double dumbbell reverse flys 10/5kg – 22,5/10lb.</p><p>Rest 60 seconds between sets</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 4.8.12.16 reps of</p><p>Heavy dumbbell suitcase deadilfts 30/22,5kg – 65/50lb.</p><p>Heavy dumbbell overhead squats</p><p>Strict pull-ups</p><p>Rest 90 seconds between sets</p><p>(switch arms as you want)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 61/43kg – 135/95lb. —&gt; 52/34kg – 115/75lb.</p><p>10/5kg – 22,5/10lb. —&gt; 7,5/2,5kg – 15/5lb.</p><p>B. 30/22,5kg – 65/50lb. —&gt; 25/15kg – 55/35lb.</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Barbell Cycling</strong></p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>10 snatches @ 65%</p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>10 snatches @ 70%</p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>10 snatches @ 75%</p><p>100 double-unders</p><p>10 snatches @ 80%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>The goal is to move efficiently with the barbell under metabolic fatigue. Go the double-unders unbroken, if you break take a breath and continue immediately with the remaining reps. Go the snatches either power or squat. It is recommended that you start the low percentages with single reps of power snatches at a steady tempo (minimum rest between lifts) and as the load gets heavier switch to squat snatches by maintaining your tempo as equally similar to that of the power snatches as you can. Load the barbell on your own and make sure you practice fast transitions.</p><p>% of Max Squat Snatch</p><p>—</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics Conditioning</strong></p><p>30/23 calories, Assault bike</p><p>20 toes to bar</p><p>10 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>20/15 calories, Assault bike</p><p>10 toes to bar</p><p>30 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>10/8 calories, Assault bike</p><p>30 toes to bar</p><p>20 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Push fast through the calories moving explosively on the assault bike, then<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>go straight to the toes to bar and try to go unbroken for as long as you can.
