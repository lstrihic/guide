Improve power and stability. Focus on a powerful pull and an explosive solid jerk. Prefer to go with split jerks and work on technique. Rest no less than 90 seconds between sets, no more than 15 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>For time</p><p>60 wall-balls 9/6kg – 20/14lb.</p><p>40 toes to bar</p><p>20 deadlifts 124/83kg – 275/185lb.</p><p>40/30 calories, Row</p><p>20 deadlifts 124/83kg – 275/185lb.</p><p>40 toes to bar</p><p>60 wall-balls 9/6kg – 20/14lb.</p><p>Cap: 20 minutes</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>In this workout you find two sequences of the same exercises and you need to follow two tempos. Go at a steadier and more manageable pace until you complete the 40 calories on the row and then increase effort and try to reach a faster pace that will lead to a strong finish. If you are really comfortable with wall-ball shots go the first set unbroken, if not break into a big and no more than 1-2 smaller sets with minimum rest between. Prefer to break the toes to bars and deadlifts in the first sequence into manageable sets that will allow you to move efficiently. In the inverse second sequence of the exercises go each one unbroken for as long as possible.

Go the lightweight percentages with a touch and go set and then switch to single lifts. Continue to the heavier percentages with solid single lifts at a fast tempo (minimum rest between lifts). The better you manage keeping the resting time between lightweight lifts and between heavyweight lifts equal the better your performance will be.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>30 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>15 ring muscle-ups</p><p>30 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>15 ring muscle-ups</p><p>30 meters, Handstand walk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Ideally break the handstand walk into 10-meter unbroken distances and go the ring muscle ups unbroken for as long as proper form allows.
