Rest no less than 2 minutes between sets, no more than 10 seconds between lifts.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conditioning</strong></p><p>Complete As Many Reps As Possible in 15 Minutes of</p><p>5 ring muscle-ups</p><p>7 front squats 43/30kg – 95/65lb</p><p>9 box-jumps 60/50cm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Push steadily through the total volume by moving constantly and efficiently. Ideally, go the ring muscle-ups and front squats unbroken and the box-jumps at a steady tempo, perform smooth transitions between. Alternatively, break the muscle-ups into 2 sets. Pace the biggest part of the workout (10-12 minutes) and then start pushing harder by shortening your transitions.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>5 <b>→</b> 4 <b>→</b> 3 reps of</p><p>Ring muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>*Go with 4 or 3 muscle-ups if you struggle to move unbroken with the 5 reps</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work</strong></p><p>A. 3 sets of</p><p>8 double dumbbell devils presses 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>12 double dumbbell thrusters</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. 3 sets of</p><p>20 single arm bent-over rows (10/10 each arm) 22,5/15kg – 50/35lb</p><p>10 double dumbbell reverse flyes 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>22,5/15kg – 50/35lb → 15/10kg – 35/22,5lb → 12,5/7,5kg – 27,5/15lb → 10/5kg – 22,5/12,5lb</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strength/Gymnastics</strong></p><p>For form</p><p>10.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1 rest of</p><p>Deadlifts 143/90kg – 315/200lb</p><p>Handstand walk, 7,5 meters</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Perform 10 deadlifts + 7,5 meters handstand walk + 9 deadlifts + 7,5 meters HSW + …… + 1 deadlift + 7,5 meters HSW.

Start smoothly by breaking the high-rep rounds of deadlifts into no more than 2-3 sets with short to minimum rest between, as reps decrease push harder and go for unbroken rounds.
