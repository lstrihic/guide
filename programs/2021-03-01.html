Ideally go both exercises unbroken for as long as possible breaking 2-3 reps before reaching failure, take short to minimum rest between and continue. Alternatively break from the start into manageable sets that will allow you to keep moving efficiently. Go smoothly on the first round and push harder as reps decrease. If you need to break, prefer to break the squats rather than the gymnastics.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>A. 61/43kg – 135/95lb <b>→</b> 52/37kg – 115/80lb</p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p>Choose pull-ups if you can’t go 10 unbroken reps of chest to bar pull-ups while fresh.</p><p>B. 82/52kg – 180/115lb <b>→</b> 61/43kg – 135/95lb</p><p>Bar muscle-ups <b>→</b> chest to bar pull-ups</p><p>Choose chest to bar pull-ups if you can’t go 5 unbroken reps of bar muscle-ups while fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.
