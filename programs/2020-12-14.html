Focus on a powerful pull and a steady overhead position. Warm up with an empty barbell and continue with sets of 2-3 reps until you reach 70%.

Try to achieve high performance in each set. Go the exercises of the first, low-rep rounds unbroken with smooth transitions between them (unbroken gymnastics, touch and go unbroken lifts). As reps of each round increase start breaking each exercise into a big and a smaller set with short to minimum rest between. On the thrusters prefer to go unbroken for as long as you can before you drop, on the cleans dont hesitate to go with single lifts if you realise that touch and go is no more efficient or forces you to take big rest.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Chest to bar pull-ups <b>→</b> pull-ups</p><p>*Go with pull-ups if you can’t perform at least 10 unbroken reps chest to bar pull-ups while fresh.</p><p><b>—</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessory Work – Core Strength</strong></p><p>A.

Focus on consistency, maintain a steady pace on the rower, 1:52.0/500m for men | 2:02.0/500m for women, and a fast, steady tempo on the bar-facing burpees over. Once you complete the couplet go straight to the max-cal set, move steadily at a sustainable pace that will allow you keep pushing efficiently until the last second. The more the remaining time the steadier your pace, the less the remaining time, the faster your pace.</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p><p>Assault bike <b>→</b> row</p>
